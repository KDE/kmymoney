This Handbook-5.2 branch is specifically for preparing the Handbook for the
upcoming (but not yet scheduled) release of KMyMoney 5.2 from master branch.
Use of a separate branch rather than working in master branch is intended to
save the translators from extra work, as there are likely to be multiple
edits to some sections, as well as reorganizations of the material.

If you are interested in contributing, please contact
ostroffjh@users.sourceforge.net so multiple people are not working on the
same chapters at the same time.

I expect that there will be changes ONLY in the doc subdirectory.

Update of screenshots will be left for later in the process, but
descriptions of what changes or new screenshots are needed can/should be
placed below the existing or target location.

At some point, I will add to this doc a list of which chapters have and have
not been edited yet, and not use the list used for the 4 -> 5 changes in the
What's New section.
