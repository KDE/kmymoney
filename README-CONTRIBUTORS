This Handbook-5.2 branch is specifically for preparing the Handbook for the
upcoming (but not yet scheduled) release of KMyMoney 5.2 from master branch.
Use of a separate branch rather than working in master branch is intended to
save the translators from extra work, as there are likely to be multiple
edits to some sections, as well as reorganizations of the material.

If you are interested in contributing, please contact
ostroffjh@users.sourceforge.net so multiple people are not working on the
same chapters at the same time.

This branch should have changes ONLY in the doc subdirectory.

Update of screenshots will be left for later in the process, but
descriptions of what changes or new screenshots are needed can/should be
placed below the existing or target location.

I have removed from the handbook the list used for tracking which chapters were
updated for the 4 -> 5 changes in the What's New section.  It is no longer useful or
needed as this version will be released with the release of 5.2, ane really should be
complete by then.

----------------

Items which need to be addressed, but so far not sure where (or more likely in
multiple places.

- Some author entities seem NOT to be in the current contributor.entities, although
  they had supposedly been added to svn quite a while ago.  Need to confirm all, and
  re-add any which are not currently present.

- Need to determine what to do about email address for deceased contributor.

- Need consistency in capitalization of Xxx View.  What about View Selector?

- In Institutuions and Accounts Views, balance is in currency of the account, total
  value is in base currency.  Need to confirm, and see how/if this affects roll-up of
  values in various displays/views and reports.

- In Categories View, Balance and Total Value - which get rolled up under what
  circumstances?

- I'd really like to avoid use of the word account when talking about tags.

- most view selectors are "all of your..." why are Payees different?  Also need to
  use payee/payor earlier.  The definition should not be in this description.

- Add a section on platform specific known issues, and reference it in the makemost
  of section.

- Need an early mention of region/country differences. VAT, for example.

- Firstuse says KMM keeps all your data in a file.  Need to add note about where else
  any info id kept (.local/.config for settings, rc file for checkprinting, ... and
  others?)  Also not sure where to mention that sql storage is treated as another
  type of file.

- Where are config files located?  Handbook currently says $KDEHOME/share/config, but
  I find it $KDEHOME/kmymoney where $KDEHOME is ~/.config) and other stuff in
  ~/.local/share/kmymoney.

- is there a "man file" equivalent on Mac and Windows? (referenced in Launching
  section of Firsttime.

- running 'kmymoney path-to-file' says can import a gnucash file.  Import or open
  into kmm format?

- why is account type column not shown in Institutions View?

- Confirm IBAN, Bank Code, SWIFT/BIC only apply to accounts, not institutions, and
  explain only to the bank where the account is.

- Deleting an Institution orphans any accounts without warning, and they do not
  appear under the "Institution for accounts with no institution" until after a
  restart of KMM.

- "...all the..." or "...all your..."

- In Accounts View, the type of "Favorite" is "Asset" instead of "Favorite" or blank.

- Be consistent: click something or click on something?

- Why do we mix "preferred" and "favorite" account designation?  Are they any different?

- do we still have the issue that you cannot edit a loan account, only the schedule
  which was created for paying the loan?

- Are loans with 0% now allowed?  Need to know for wording about loan accounts.

- do we want to talk about stock as an account type?

- Bug 272737 is that categories and account hierarchies cannot be dragged to new
  location.  It seems this is still not implemented.  Will it ever be?  I'm not sure
  it's really needed, since you just click on the new parent and click OK (or Apply?)

- There are several tabs in the Edit Account dialog which are not included in the New
  Account dialog.  Should these also be there?

- Confirm wording of VAT percentage in Edit Account section.

- Is CC (cost center) used for anything?  Does it occur anywhere except Categories
  (which is only that cc is required)

- In New Category dialog, Price entry dropdown is disabled.  Is there any condition
  under which it is enabled?  If so, need to add to handbook.

- TMTOWTDI: right-click here, click there.  Do we put multiple ways in lots of
  places, or just a first description and then single way in most descriptions?

- do we need a Tags main menu item?

- confirm which import methods are or are not able to import tags.

- do we want to be consistent about whether descriptions are above/below/or mixed in
  relation to the screenshot they describe?

- in Tabbed sections, the sect titles are sometimes just the tab title, but sometimes
  more descriptive (see Payees Details)  Do we want this to be consistent?

- The handbook uses "Schedules" as the formal name, but the View Selector says
  "Scheduled transactions" We should be consistent.

- On schecule frequency, should we comment on possibly odd combinations of frequency
  and the interval?  What happens if you say 2 Once?  Is 2 Month the same as 1 Every
  half month or 1 Every two months?

- Price downloads allow you to specify data (date range?) yet this is never used in
  actually fetching prices (stocks or currency.)  Should we just drop the field, or
  at least note it is ignored?  IS there any way to retreive historic prices?

- Can the transaction form show up other than at the bottom of the transaction list?
  With or without the form enabled, editing a transaction shows the form at the
  location of the transaction in the ledger.  Shouldn't editing take place in the
  form at the bottom?

- for clarifications, can a transaction only be split on one side?  It does make
  sense to restrict a transaction to only one account on one side, but would allowing
  both sides be split cause any real problem, or just too much confusion?

- In Investment account ledger, Activity has a blue border when selected, but
  Security and Account have the name highlighted when the field is selected.  Why the
  difference.

- Can you really not match two non-imported transactions?  If so, then the date
  always comes from the imported transaction.

- The Security dropdown and column in an Investment ledger shows only the name of the
  security.  Should it also show the symbol?  (The manual used to say it did.)

- Manual says KMM can download the latest prices from the web.  Should we just
  specify "current" prices?  Although there is a date field for price fetch, it is
  ignored.  How do we want to deal with this?

- online quote page parser, date field order.  Did we recently have a case where it
  needed to be altered due to field separators in the date?  It shouldn't, so am I
  mis-remembering, or was there a problem?

- Price Editor dialog first column is labelled Commodity, but in New price entry, it
  is called Security.  Shouldn't this be consistent?

- Reconciliatiohn wizard interest/charge dialog - should it allow split entries?  Might
  be unlikely for interest, but you might have credit card interest plus fees.

- Can we change the order of reports in the Reports View to make more sense?  (Look at
  Tranacions reports for an example)

- Report section CashFlow - should this be Cash Flow (with a space between?)

- what are cash-flow related transactions?  How is the term defined?

- Can the tabs in the Reports View get an "X" to close them, instead of needing to use
  the "Close report" button?

- In Gnucash import, matching of account types, some map to things that are only
  applicable to security subaccounts of investmant accounts.  Should these be shown
  separately, with an explanation?

- Importing gnucash schedules talks about if it causes fatal errors.  Is this while
  importing, or while running later?

- doc says not all report types are matched - what happens if they don't?

- is the QIF Profile input filter location a single file or a command?  Does it just use
  a single file as the program, and anything more than that as a command to be invoked?

- CSV importer wizard, Separators page, for three dropdowns at the bottom, the labels
  to the left of them are not all aligned the same.  The top seems to be centered in
  a larger area, the bottom two are right aligned.

- CSV importer: list of steps is lower left in most of wizard, but all of left on start
  page.  Should it be lower left on all for consistancy?

- CSV importer - Banking cols, many have "X" to clear the value, and ther is "clear all."
  Investment cols do not have "x" and only "Clear" not "Clear all", plus Clear Fee.

- Why is "Reconciled" not an option on the transaction state dropdown in the filter
  section of the ledger?

- I'd like to be consistent in use or not of inline icons when describing where to click
  to do something, but I'm deferring as too much effort for now.

- The split editor window title is just "Dialog."  The title of the window for
  actually editing a single split is "Slit transaction."  We need better terms that make
  more sense.

- Payees entered in a split, show up in the memo of the transaction, like memos and
  tags.  Perhaps they should be displayed in the Payee field, perhaps in parens with
  the payy from each split?)

- (from an otherwise resolved FIXME in the split transaction section) do we have
  adequate description of currency conversion?  I THINK so, but am leaving this
  comment for confirmation.

- It is also not clear if we need more detail on what can be a split (account instead
  of category?) and where that would be described.

- Where should we describe the Undo feature?

- transaction matching section of Ledgers chapter - first, are matched transactions
  still highlighted in green?  If not, how?

- Need more details on the descriptions of all the transaction status features in the
  filter dropdown? 

- Is it still true you can not match two imported or two not-imported transactions?

- Should there be a note about the relation between aqbanking, kbanking, and hbci?

- Budget View has buttons labelled Upd and Res.  Should these be expanded to Update and Reset?

This is a list of potential enhancements I came up with while reviewing the handbook,
but have not yet posted either as wishlist bugs, entries to any Issue on invent, or
elsewhere.

- In the Institutions View, configure the ability to allow not showing an institution
  with no open accounts

- In Views with selectable columns, allow reordering of those columns, and make it
  easier to add/remove more than one column at a time when right clicking in thr
  header row.

- Do we want to allow selecting right v left justification of any columns?  (mainly
  thinking of date in Schedules View.

- In multi column views, allow not forcing use of full width, i.e., don't force
  rightmost column to right edge of window.

- Consider reordering the View Selector.  Categories right after Accounts, move
  Schedules down directly above Ledgers?  Payees above Tags

- Should the Account View (Institutions also?) include Currency column?

- New Schedule dialog is still titled "Edit Scheduled transaction"

- should register be replaced with ledger wherever it is used?

- If the transaction form is displayed, a single selected transaction is shown in the
  form.  However, if you unselect the transaction, it remains displaye in the form.
  If you select additional transaction, the last one selected is shown in the form.
  There seems no danger, since the form is not editable, but it does seem odd.

- all data items specified when creating or editing an object should be displayed on
  the main view for that object.  For example identification number for stocks is not
  shown anywhere else.

- In report configuration dialog, if the report has not been run (select configure from
  the reports list) and you close, do not actually run the report.

- In the Budgets View, the list of categories on the right does not allow resizing
  columns.  In addition, with all columns displayed, the Name column is so narrow you
  do not even see the first letters of the name, only the income or expense icon.

- In the Budgets View, should the list on the right be called the Accounts List or
  the Categories List?  The doc does mention that categories are accounts, but given
  this list is restricted to categories only, ....?

- In the Budgets View, the three sections on the right cannot be resized, although it is
  possible to adjust the division between the right and left sections.

- Forecast View - clicking the Chart tab takes (can take?) a LONG time.  Users need a
  way to interrupt any such very long operation.  In my experience, these are in reports
  over all time and accounts, and this graphic.

- In Edit Account, bottom of General tab, Budget Options allows account to be
  included in budgets as Income or Expense.  Does this essentially allow to include
  transfers to/from this account in budgets?

- In Forecast, the Advanced tab seems to show one fewer cycle than expected.

- Forecast View, Budget tab seems final column really is Total, not anything
  predicted, and values seem history predicted, even though my Forecast Method is
  Scheduled.

- Search dialog - some tabs say "All"/"None" but some say "Select all"/"Select none."
  These should be consisstent.

- The Search Dialog Deatils subtab has a problem with vertical alignment.  "Search
  number in range" is at the vertical midpoint of from and to (looks good) but
  "Search this number" seems lower than the text field for that number.

- Search results should include (optional) Number column if you can search on it.

- Cant search results be sorted any more?  (Could they ever?)

- Need to mention in file formats chapter that all data files can be stored locally
  or on a network share.  Also mention mounting the share is often an issue on Windows.

- what does File/Backup do if SQL is the current file type?

- on the config dialog, home section, should the top area be put in a box as are the
  other two areas, and most of the contents on the other sections?

- Forecast View - doesn't seem to change forecast method without restarting KMM.

- "Show all split details in ledger" acts inconsistenly.  With a split transaction,
  if a split has a memo, that memo is shown in stead of the second category.  I don't
  know if this is related to the bug I just filed about splits getting duplicated if
  you toggle that setting while the transaction is open for editing.

- Is there any consistency or pattern in config dialogs where something with a small
  number of choicees is presented as a dropdown or a set of radio-button items?  For
  example, Ledger configuration, Data Entry tab: Default reconciliation state is
  dropdown with three choices, but Autofill has three radio-button choices.
