This Handbook-5.2 branch is specifically for preparing the Handbook for the
upcoming (but not yet scheduled) release of KMyMoney 5.2 from master branch.
Use of a separate branch rather than working in master branch is intended to
save the translators from extra work, as there are likely to be multiple
edits to some sections, as well as reorganizations of the material.

If you are interested in contributing, please contact
ostroffjh@users.sourceforge.net so multiple people are not working on the
same chapters at the same time.

This branch should have changes ONLY in the doc subdirectory.

Update of screenshots will be left for later in the process, but
descriptions of what changes or new screenshots are needed can/should be
placed below the existing or target location.

I have removed from the handbook the list used for tracking which chapters were
updated for the 4 -> 5 changes in the What's New section.  It is no longer useful or
needed as this version will be released with the release of 5.2, ane really should be
complete by then.

----------------

Items which need to be addressed, but so far not sure where (or more likely in
multiple places.

- Need consistency in capitalization of Xxx View.  What about View Selector?

- In Institutuions and Accounts Views, balance is in currency of the account, total
  value is in base currency.  Need to confirm, and see how/if this affects roll-up.

- In Categories View, Balance and Total Value - which get rolled up under what
  circumstances?

- I'd really like to avoid use of the word account when talking about tags.

- most view selectors are "all of your..." why are Payees different?  Also need to
  use payee/payor earlier.  The definition should not be in this description.

- Add a section on platform specific known issues, and reference it in the makemost
  of section.

- Need an early mention of region/country differences. VAT, for example.

- Firstuse says KMM keeps all your data in a file.  Need to add note about where else
  any info id kept (.local/.config for settings, rc file for checkprinting, ... and
  others?)  Also not sure where to mention that sql storage is treated as another
  type of file.

- Where are config files located?  Handbook currently says $KDEHOME/share/config, but
  I find it $KDEHOME/kmymoney where $KDEHOME is ~/.config) and other stuff in
  ~/.local/share/kmymoney.

- is there a "man file" equivalent on Mac and Windows? (referenced in Launching
  section of Firsttime.

- running 'kmymoney path-to-file' says can import a gnucash file.  Import or open
  into kmm format?

- why is account type column not shown in Institutions View?

- Confirm IBAN, Bank Code, SWIFT/BIC only apply to accounts, not institutions, and
  explain only to the bank where the account is.

- Deleting an Institution orphans any accounts without warning, and they do not
  appear under the "Institution for accounts with no institution" until after a
  restart of KMM.

- "...all the..." or "...all your..."

- In Accounts View, the type of "Favorite" is "Asset" instead of "Favorite" or blank.

- Be consistent: click something or click on something?

- Why do we mix "preferred" and "favorite" account designation?  Are they any different?

- do we still have the issue that you cannot edit a loan account, only the schedule
  which was created for paying the loan?

- Are loans with 0% now allowed?  Need to know for wording about loan accounts.

- do we want to talk about stock as an account type?

- Bug 272737 is that categories and account hierarchies cannot be dragged to new
  location.  It seems this is still not implemented.  Will it ever be?  I'm not sure
  it's really needed, since you just click on the new parent and click OK (or Apply?)

- There are several tabs in the Edit Account dialog which are not included in the New
  Account dialog.  Should these also be there?

- Confirm wording of VAT percentage in Edit Account section.

- Is CC (cost center) used for anything?  Does it occur anywhere except Categories
  (which is only that cc is required)

- In New Category dialog, Price entry dropdown is disabled.  Is there any condition
  under which it is enabled?  If so, need to add to handbook.

- TMTOWTDI: right-click here, click there.  Do we put multiple ways in lots of
  places, or just a first description and then single way in most descriptions?

- do we need a Tags main menu item?

- confirm which import methods are or are not able to import tags.

- do we want to be consistent about whether descriptions are above/below/or mixed in
  relation to the screenshot they describe?

- in Tabbed sections, the sect titles are sometimes just the tab title, but sometimes
  more descriptive (see Payees Details)  Do we want this to be consistent?

- The handbook uses "Schedules" as the formal name, but the View Selector says
  "Scheduled transactions" We should be consistent.

- On schecule frequency, should we comment on possibly odd combinations of frequency
  and the interval?  What happens if you say 2 Once?  Is 2 Month the same as 1 Every
  half month or 1 Every two months?

- Price downloads allow you to specify data (date range?) yet this is never used in
  actually fetching prices (stocks or currency.)  Should we just drop the field, or
  at least note it is ignored?  IS there any way to retreive historic prices?

- Can the transaction form show up other than at the bottom of the transaction list?
  With or without the form enabled, editing a transaction shows the form at the
  location of the transaction in the ledger.  Shouldn't editing take place in the
  form at the bottom?

- for clarifications, can a transaction only be split on one side?  It does make
  sense to restrict a transaction to only one account on one side, but would allowing
  both sides be split cause any real problem, or just too much confusion?

- In Investment account ledger, Activity has a blue border when selected, but
  Security and Account have the name highlighted when the field is selected.  Why the
  difference.

- Can you really not match two non-imported transactions?  If so, then the date
  always comes from the imported transaction.


  ----------------

This is a list of potential enhancements I came up with while reviewing the handbook,
but have not yet posted either as wishlist bugs, entries to any Issue on invent, or
elsewhere.

- In the Institutions View, configure the ability to allow not showing an institution
  with no open accounts

- In Views with selectable columns, allow reordering of those columns, and make it
  easier to add/remove more than one column at a time when right clicking in thr
  header row.

- Do we want to allow selecting right v left justification of any columns?  (mainly
  thinking of date in Schedules View.

- In multi column views, allow not forcing use of full width, i.e., don't force
  rightmost column to right edge of window.

- Consider reordering the View Selector.  Categories right after Accounts, move
  Schedules down directly above Ledgers?  Payees above Tags

- Should the Account View (Institutions also?) include Currency column?

- New Schedule dialog is still titled "Edit Scheduled transaction"

- should register be replaced with ledger wherever it is used?

- If the transaction form is displayed, a single selected transaction is shown in the
  form.  However, if you unselect the transaction, it remains displaye in the form.
  If you select additional transaction, the last one selected is shown in the form.
  There seems no danger, since the form is not editable, but it does seem odd.

- all data items specified when creating or editing an object should be displayed on
  the main view for that object.  For example identification number for stocks is not
  shown anywhere else.
