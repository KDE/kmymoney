This Handbook-5.2 branch is specifically for preparing the Handbook for the upcoming
(but not yet scheduled) release of KMyMoney 5.2 from master branch.  Use of a
separate branch rather than working in master branch is intended to save the
translators from extra work, as there are likely to be multiple edits to some
sections, as well as reorganizations of the material.

If you are interested in contributing, please contact ostroffjh@users.sourceforge.net
so multiple people are not working on the same chapters at the same time.

This branch should have changes ONLY in the doc subdirectory.  Master is merged into
this branch on occasion to keep this true.

Update of screenshots will be left for later in the process, but descriptions of what
changes or new screenshots are needed can/should be placed below the existing or
target location.

I have removed from the What's New chapter the list used for tracking which chapters
were updated for the 4 -> 5 changes.  It is no longer useful or needed as this
version will be released with the release of 5.2, and should really be complete by
then.

All chapters have had at least one pass, with the following exceptions:

I have added a note to the MakeMostOf chapter requesting suggestions for improvement.
I would really like to totally replace it, but have no good ideas, so it stays mostly
as is for now.

CSV import/export chapter probably needs lots more work.

For import in general, I'd love to add a discussion of what parts are file type
  specific, and what things are done after an import is processed into a common
  format for final processing.

The Woob import chapter needs review by Woob user.

The Budgets chapter needs additional screenshots.

The Widgets chapter needs to be reviewed by Thomas

The man page, while not directly included in the docbook, still be reviewed for
accuracy.

----------------

Items which need to be addressed, but so far not sure where (or more likely in multiple places)

- Some author entities seem NOT to be in the current contributor.entities, although they had
  supposedly been added to svn quite a while ago.  Need to confirm all, and re-add any which are not
  currently present.

- In Institutuions and Accounts Views, balance is in currency of the account, total value is in base
  currency.  Need to confirm, and see how/if this affects roll-up of values in various
  displays/views and reports.

- In Categories View, Balance and Total Value - which get rolled up under what circumstances?

- I'd really like to avoid use of the word account when talking about tags.

- Add a section on platform specific issues, and reference it in the makemost of section.  (Do we
  want to summarize "known issues" on the web site to stop duplicate reports?  could include
  pointers to bugs, invent issues, discuss topics, and such.)

- Need an early mention of region/country differences. VAT, for example.

- Firstuse says KMM keeps all your data in a file.  Need to add note about where else any info id
  kept (.local/.config for settings, rc file for checkprinting, ... and others?)  Also not sure
  where to mention that sql storage is treated as another type of file.

- Where are config files located?  Handbook currently says $KDEHOME/share/.config, but I find it
  $KDEHOME/kmymoney where $KDEHOME is ~/.config) and other stuff in ~/.local/share/kmymoney.

- is there a "man file" equivalent on Mac and Windows? (referenced in Launching section of
  Firsttime.

- running 'kmymoney path-to-file' says can import a gnucash file.  Import or open
  into kmm format?

- why is account type column not shown in Institutions View?

- Confirm IBAN, Bank Code, SWIFT/BIC only apply to accounts, not institutions, and
  explain only to the bank where the account is.

- (was this dealt with?)  Deleting an Institution orphans any accounts without
  warning, and they do not appear under the "Institution for accounts with no
  institution" until after a restart of KMM.

- "...all the..." or "...all your..."

- In Accounts View, the type of "Favorite" is "Asset" instead of "Favorite" or blank.

- I decided to use "click" and not "click on" but the style suggestions I read suggest that "click"
  may not be best.  I know we don't have to worry about "tap" as we don't have a mobile version, but
  there are touchpad laptops and screen readers to consider.  I'll leave "click" for now, but will
  revisit and consider "select."  There is also a question of whether you need to specify the type
  of object being selected; I have delete explicit "button" references, but not "icon," and I'm
  still undecided about "link."

- We still have the issue that you cannot edit a loan account, only the schedule which was created
  for paying the loan (see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386186).  Note some items can be
  updated (FIXME - need to confirm all updated - drag/drop for hierarchy, and name and something
  else in existing wizard.)

- Confirm wording of VAT percentage in Edit Account section.

- TMTOWTDI: right-click here, click there.  Do we put multiple ways in lots of places, or just a
  first description and then single way in most descriptions?

- confirm which import methods are or are not able to import tags.

- Should we want be consistent about whether descriptions are above/below/or mixed in relation to
  the screenshot they describe?

- in Tabbed sections, the sect titles are sometimes just the tab title, but sometimes more
  descriptive (see Payees Details) Do we want this to and can it be consistent?

- Can you really not match two imported or two non-imported transactions?  In the latter case, then
  the date always comes from the imported transaction.

- online quote page parser, date field order.  Did we recently have a case where it needed to be
  altered due to field separators in the date?  It shouldn't, so am I mis-remembering, or was there
  a problem?

- How much of the online price retrieval needs to be re-written due to moving that functionality to
  libalkimia?

- Price Editor dialog first column is labelled Commodity, but in New price entry, it is called
  Security.  Shouldn't this be consistent?

- what are cash-flow related transactions?  How (and where) is the term defined?

- CSV importer wizard, Separators page, for three dropdowns at the bottom, the labels to the left of
  them are not all aligned the same.  The top seems to be centered in a larger area, the bottom two
  are right aligned. *** MR225 ***

- CSV importer: list of steps is lower left in most of wizard, but all of left on start page.
  Should it be lower left on all for consistency?

- CSV importer - Banking cols, many have "X" to clear the value, and there is "clear all."
  Investment cols do not have "x" and only "Clear" not "Clear all", plus Clear Fee.  Low priority to
  make consistent?

- I'd like to be consistent in use or not of inline icons when describing where to click
  to do something, but I'm deferring as too much effort for now.

- (from resolved FIXME on split transactions) do we have adequate description of currency
  conversion?  I THINK so, but am leaving this comment for confirmation.

- Should iCalendar be mentioned anywhere other than the Settings chapter?

- The FAQ chapter needs checking for coordination with our online version, specifically
  https://userbase.kde.org/KMyMoney/FAQ#How_do_I_configure_online_banking_.3F"

This is a list of potential enhancements I came up with while reviewing the handbook,
but have not yet posted either as wishlist bugs, entries to any Issue on invent, or
elsewhere.

- In the Institutions View, configure the ability to allow not showing an institution with no open
  accounts

- In Views with selectable columns, allow reordering of those columns, and make it easier to
  add/remove more than one column at a time when right clicking in thr header row.  (partly done?)

- Do we want to allow selecting right v left justification of any columns?  (mainly thinking of date
  in Schedules View.

- In multi column views, allow not forcing use of full width, i.e., don't force rightmost column to
  right edge of window (or allow left-justifying that column.)

- Consider reordering the View Selector.  Categories should be right after Accounts.  Schedules should be 
  directly above Ledgers.  Payees should be above Tags.

- Should the Accounts and Institutions Views include Currency column?

- New Schedule dialog is still titled "Edit Scheduled transaction"

- If the transaction form is displayed, a single selected transaction is shown in the form.
  However, if you unselect the transaction, it remains displaye in the form.  If you select
  additional transaction, the last one selected is shown in the form.  There seems no danger, since
  the form is not editable, but it does seem odd.

- all data items specified when creating or editing an object should be displayed on the main view
  for that object.  For example identification number for stocks is not shown anywhere else.

- In report configuration dialog, if the report has not been run (select configure from the reports
  list) need to allow closing without actually runing the report.

- In the Budgets View, the list of categories on the right does not allow resizing columns.  In
  addition, with all columns displayed, the Name column is so narrow you do not even see the first
  letters of the name, only the income or expense icon.

- In the Budgets View, should the list on the right be called the Accounts List or the Categories
  List?  The doc does mention that categories are accounts, but given this list is restricted to
  categories only, ....?

- In the Budgets View, the three sections on the right cannot be resized, although it is possible to
  adjust the division between the right and left sections.

- Forecast View - clicking the Chart tab takes (can take?) a LONG time.  Users need a way to
  interrupt any such very long operation.  In my experience, these are in graphical reports over all
  time and accounts.

- In Forecast View, the Advanced tab seems to show one fewer cycle than expected.

- Forecast View, Budget tab it seems final column really is Total, not anything predicted, and
  values seem history predicted, even though my Forecast Method is Scheduled.

- Forecast View - doesn't seem to change forecast method without restarting KMM.

- Search dialog - some tabs say "All"/"None" but some say "Select all"/"Select none."  These should
  be consistent.

- The Search Dialog Details subtab has a problem with vertical alignment.  "Search number in range"
  is at the vertical midpoint of from and to (looks good) but "Search this number" seems lower than
  the text field for that number.

- Search results should include (optional) Number column, since it seems you can search on it.

- Can search results be sorted any more?  (Could they ever?)

- what does File/Backup do if SQL is the current file type?

- on the config dialog, home section, should the top area be put in a box as are the other two
  areas, and most of the contents on the other sections?

- "Show all split details in ledger" seems to act inconsistently.  With a split transaction, if a
  split has a memo, that memo is shown instead of the second category.  I don't know if this is
  related to the bug I filed (and now can't find) about splits getting duplicated if you toggle that
  setting while the transaction is open for editing.

- Is there any consistency or pattern in config dialogs where something with a small number of
  choicees is presented as a dropdown or a set of radio-button items?  For example, Ledger
  configuration, Data Entry tab: Default reconciliation state is dropdown with three choices, but
  Autofill has three radio-button choices.

- In Edit Account, bottom of General tab, Budget Options allows account to be included in budgets as
  Income or Expense.  This actually adds the account as Asset or Liability, not Income or Expense.
  However, I still see no evicence of any such account in any budget report.  Perhaps this should
  just be left as is, and raised as an issue after 5.2?

------------------------ resolved issues for now, but still need future discussion

- do we want to talk about stock as an account type? - will defer, including possible terminology
  changes (equity/stock/security) when we get to major investment overhaul.

- Bug 272737 is that categories and account hierarchies cannot be dragged to new location.  This was
  actually fixed a while ago, but when you click on new parent and then OK, instead of just updating
  the hierarchy, the whole dialog is closed.  Is this OK?

- In New Category dialog, Price entry and CC were dropped.  Should we also drop Last Check number?

- On schedule frequency, should we comment on possibly odd combinations of frequency and the
  interval?  What happens if you say 2 Once?  Is 2 Month the same as 1 Every half month or 1 Every
  two months?
  -- wording updated, but I wonder if we should eliminate all intervals which are multiples of other
     intervals.  However, the confusion of making the change might be worse than the confusion when
     picking the right frequency and interval.

- Price downloads allow you to specify data (date range?) yet this is never used in actually
  fetching prices (stocks or currency.)  Should we just drop the field, or at least note it is
  ignored?  IS there any way to retrieve historic prices? (How does this relate to the more of price
  downloads to alkimia?

  >> T This has recently changed. If the price source has a #x in its regex for price or date then
       it expects the data to be in CSV format. In such a case, the date fields are enabled but only
       used for that price source.
    > J2 I need to try it, if I can find any source with historic data.  Otherwise, I suppose I can
	 just save any changes about this for later.
    T2 I attach a screenshot of my settings for this. And here are those settings for copy/paste:

    [Online-Quote-Source-KMyMoney Currency Historic.local]
    DataFormat=2
    DateFormatRegex=%d %m %y
    DateRegex=#1
    DefaultId=
    DownloadType=0
    IDBy=0
    IDRegex=
    PriceDecimalSeparator=0
    PriceRegex=#2
    URL=https://fx-rate.net/historical/?c_input=%1&cp_input=%2&csv=true

    You could also use the Install button and select the fx-rate.net historical one (which is the
    same as above). All this is functionality obtained from the latest Alkimia.  Ralf can probably
    provide more info about that.  Also, attached as screenshot.
    1) you can hit "Install" more than once.  The button should be disabled while the dialog is
       displayed.
    2) the current list (for Install) all show ratings 5/10 but none have any ratings.  Should I
       take this up with KDE GHNS?
    3) on New Account in currency other than base currency, even after downloading a conversion
       rate, the text below the rate says 1 USD -> 1 EUR (with appropriate symbols).  Shouldn't that
       get updated?  Also, if you are explicitly looking for conversion on date of account opening,
       why does it fetch today's rate?
    4) I did add the new conversion source, but I can't figure out how to use it.  Do I need to
       change it's name?
    5) Even after installing the new source, if I select it in the Online Quotes dialog, all the
       fields below remain disabled.  I have alkimia as of yesterday.  Is it not recent enough?  Am
       I missing some other configuration setting?

- (related to above issue) Manual says KMM can download the latest prices from the web.  Should we
  just specify "current" prices?  Although there is a date field for price fetch, it is ignored.
  How do we want to deal with this?

- Transaction form shows up always at the bottom of the transaction list.  With or without the form
  enabled, editing a transaction shows the form at the location of the transaction in the ledger.
  Shouldn't editing take place in the form at the bottom if it is enabled?
 -- There have been changes here.  Transaction form is always at the bottom (when enabled) and it
    disappears when entering or editing a transaction (always done in the ledger)
   1) Why is the transaction form not shown for Investment Accounts?
   2) Please confirm that the transaction form is now display only, and entering new and editing
      existing transactions is now always done within the ledger, at which time the transaction form
      is not displayed (even if enabled).  Otherwise, the transaction form shows the details of the
      most recently selected transaction.  (If I Ctl-Click, it shows the last one clicked, but if I
      then Ctl-click a selected transaction to un-select it, that is the one shown in the form. (I
      need to revise the Handbook which still says both ways can be used to enter/edit transactions.

- The handbook uses "Schedules" as the formal name, but the View Selector says "Scheduled
  transactions."  Should we be consistent and shorten it?  (hard to find in code, since it includes
  \n.

- In Gnucash import, matching of account types, some map to things that are only applicable to
  security subaccounts of investmant accounts.  Should these be shown separately, with an
  explanation?

  -- Importing gnucash schedules talks about if it causes fatal errors.  Is this while importing, or
     while running later?

  -- doc says not all report types are matched - what happens if they don't?
     -- TB: I have no idea about GnuCash stuff. I need to leave those questions unanswered. Same goes
        for the CSV importer
  -- With no sufficient expertise for GnuCash or CSV importer - we leave these unanswered until we
     get a bug report or explicit request for help

- Payees entered in a split, show up in the memo of the transaction, like memos and tags.  Perhaps
  they should be displayed in the Payee field, perhaps in parens with the payee from each split?
  -- remind myself that there is no payee (nor tag, ...) for the transaction itself, only for the
     account of the displayed ledger.  Leaving active for me to confirm the description of these
     fields and their behaviour in the Handbook is correct (and also hopefully complete.)

- Where should we describe the Undo feature?
  -- Still not sure - perhaps an early page on "other changes not mentioned elsewhere?
     what else would be included?

- Should there be a note about the relation between aqbanking, kbanking, and hbci?
  -- Will mention only used in Germany, although Aqbanking can import other file types (but not used
     for those instead of native importers)
  -- Still would like a note on the relation between Aqbanking and KBanking.  (external
     libraries/routines and the KMM framework for calling them?)

- Budget View has buttons labelled Upd and Res.  Should these be expanded to Update and Reset?  --
  TB said he would remove, but I now see full text Update and Remove.  Tooltips are present and for
  those two, there is a (not useful?) "hit Shift for more".  The "more" is not very useful - should
  it just be dropped?
