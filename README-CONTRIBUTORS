This Handbook-5.2 branch is specifically for preparing the Handbook for the
upcoming (but not yet scheduled) release of KMyMoney 5.2 from master branch.
Use of a separate branch rather than working in master branch is intended to
save the translators from extra work, as there are likely to be multiple
edits to some sections, as well as reorganizations of the material.

If you are interested in contributing, please contact
ostroffjh@users.sourceforge.net so multiple people are not working on the
same chapters at the same time.

I expect that there will be changes ONLY in the doc subdirectory.

Update of screenshots will be left for later in the process, but
descriptions of what changes or new screenshots are needed can/should be
placed below the existing or target location.

At some point, I will add to this doc a list of which chapters have and have
not been edited yet, and not use the list used for the 4 -> 5 changes in the
What's New section.

----------------

Items which need to be addressed, but so far not sure where (or more likely in
multiple places.

- Need consistency in capitalization of Xxx View.  What about View Selector?

- columns which may be displayed in various Views by right clicking in header and
  selecting.  Mention for each view, but is there a general place?  FAQ?

- In Institutuions and Accounts Views, balance is in currency of the account, total
  value is in base currency.  Need to confirm, and see how/if this affects roll-up.

- In Categories View, Balance and Total Value - which get rolled up under what
  circumstances?

- I'd really like to avoid use of the word account when talking about tags.

- most view selectors are "all of your..." why are Payees different?  Also need to
  use payee/payor earlier.  The definition should not be in this description.

- Add a section on platform specific known issues, and reference it in the makemost
  of section.

- Need an early mention of region/country differences. VAT, for example.

- Firstuse says KMM keeps all your data in a file.  Need to add note about where else
  any info id kept (.local/.config for settings, rc file for checkprinting, ... and
  others?)  Also not sure where to mention that sql storage is treated as another
  type of file.

- is there a "man file" equivalent on Mac and Windows? (referenced in Launching
  section of Firsttime.

- running 'kmymoney path-to-file' says can import a gnucash file.  Import or open
  into kmm format?

- Where are config files located?  Handbook currently says $KDEHOME/share/config, but
  I find it $KDEHOME/kmymoney where $KDEHOME is ~/.config) and other stuff in
  ~/.local/share/kmymoney.

- why is account type column not shown in Institutions View?

- Confirm IBAN, Bank Code, SWIFT/BIC only apply to accounts, not institutions, and
  explain only to the bank where the account is.

- Deleting an Institution orphans any accounts without warning, and they do not appear 
  under the "Institution for accounts with no institution" until after a reboot.

- "...all the..." or "...all your..."

- In Accounts View, the type of "Favorite" is "Asset" instead of "Favorite" or blank.



----------------

This is a list of potential enhancements I came up with while reviewing the handbook,
but have not yet posted either as wishlist bugs, entries to any Issue on invent, or
elsewhere.

- In the Institutions View, configure the ability to allow not showing an institution
  with no open accounts

- In Views with selectable columns, allow reordering of those columns, and make it
  easier to add/remove more than one column at a time when right clicking in thr
  header row.

- Do we want to allow selecting right v left justification of any columns?  (mainly
  thinking of date in Schedule T View.

- In multi column views, allow not forcing use of full width, i.e., don't force
  rightmost column to right edge of window.

- Consider reordering the View Selector.  Categories right after Accounts, move
  Schedules down directly above Ledgers?  Payees above Tags
