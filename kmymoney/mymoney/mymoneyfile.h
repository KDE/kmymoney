/**
  * This class represents the interface to the MyMoney engine.
  * For historical reasons it is still called MyMoneyFile.
  * It is implemented using the singleton pattern and thus only
  * exists once for each running instance of an application.
  *
  * The instance of the MyMoneyFile object is accessed as follows:
  *
  * @code
  * MyMoneyFile *file = MyMoneyFile::instance();
  * file->anyMemberFunction();
  * @endcode
  *
  * The first line of the above code creates a unique MyMoneyFile
  * object if it is called for the first time ever. All subsequent
  * calls to this functions return a pointer to the object created
  * during the first call.
  *
  * As the MyMoneyFile object represents the business logic, a storage
  * manager must be attached to it. This mechanism allows to use different
  * access methods to store the objects. The interface to access such an
  * storage manager is defined in the class MyMoneyStorageMgr. The methods
  * attachStorage() and detachStorage() are used to attach/detach a
  * storage manager object. The following code can be used to create a
  * functional MyMoneyFile instance:
  *
  * @code
  * MyMoneyStorageMgr *storage = ....
  * MyMoneyFile *file = MyMoneyFile::instance();
  * file->attachStorage(storage);
  * @endcode
  *
  * The methods addAccount(), modifyAccount() and removeAccount() implement the
  * general account maintenance functions. The method reparentAccount() is
  * available to move an account from one superordinate account to another.
  * account() and accountList() are used to retrieve a single instance or a
  * QList of MyMoneyAccount objects.
  *
  * The methods addInstitution(), modifyInstitution() and removeInstitution()
  * implement the general institution maintenance functions. institution() and
  * institutionList() are used to retrieve a single instance or a
  * QList of MyMoneyInstitution objects.
  *
  * The methods addPayee(), modifyPayee() and removePayee()
  * implement the general payee maintenance functions.
  * payee() and payeeList() are used to retrieve a single instance or a
  * QList of MyMoneyPayee objects.
  *
  * The methods addTag(), modifyTag() and removeTag()
  * implement the general tag maintenance functions.
  * tag() and tagList() are used to retrieve a single instance or a
  * QList of MyMoneyTag objects.
  *
  * The methods addTransaction(), modifyTransaction() and removeTransaction()
  * implement the general transaction maintenance functions.
  * transaction() and transactionList() are used to retrieve
  * a single instance or a QList of MyMoneyTransaction objects.
  *
  * The methods addSecurity(), modifySecurity() and removeSecurity()
  * implement the general access to equities held in the engine.
  *
  * The methods addCurrency(), modifyCurrency() and removeCurrency()
  * implement the general access to multiple currencies held in the engine.
  * The methods baseCurrency() and setBaseCurrency() allow to retrieve/set
  * the currency selected by the user as base currency. If a currency
  * reference is empty, it will usually be interpreted as baseCurrency().
  *
  * The methods liability(), asset(), expense(), income() and equity() are
  * used to retrieve the five standard accounts. isStandardAccount()
  * checks if a given accountId references one of the or not.
  * setAccountName() is used to specify a name for the standard accounts
  * from the GUI.
  *
  * The MyMoneyFile object emits the dataChanged() signal when data
  * has been changed.
  *
  * For arbitrary values that have to be stored with the storage object
  * but are of importance to the application only, the object is derived
  * for MyMoneyKeyValueContainer which provides a container to store
  * these values indexed by an alphanumeric key.
  *
  * @exception MyMoneyException is thrown whenever an error occurs
  * while the engine code is running. The MyMoneyException:: object
  * describes the problem.
