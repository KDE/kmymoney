/**
  * This class implements a text based payee selector.
  * When initially used, the widget has the functionality of a KComboBox object.
  * Whenever a key is pressed, the set of loaded payees is searched for
  * payees names which match the currently entered text.
  *
  * If any match is found a list selection box is opened and the user can use
  * the up/down, page-up/page-down keys or the mouse to navigate in the list. If
  * a payee is selected, the selection box is closed. Other key-strokes are
  * directed to the parent object to manipulate the text.  The visible contents of
  * the selection box is updated with every key-stroke.
  *
  * This object is a replacement of the KMyMoneyPayee object and should be used
  * for new code.
