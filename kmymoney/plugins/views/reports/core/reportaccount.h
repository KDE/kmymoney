  * This is a MyMoneyAccount as viewed from the reporting engine.

  * All reporting methods should use ReportAccount INSTEAD OF
  * MyMoneyAccount at all times.
  *
  * The primary functionality this provides is a full chain of account
  * hierarchy that is easy to traverse.  It's needed because the PivotTable
  * grid needs to store and sort by the full account hierarchy, while still
  * having access to the account itself for currency conversion.
  *
  * In addition, several other convenience functions are provided that may
  * be worth moving into MyMoneyAccount at some point.
