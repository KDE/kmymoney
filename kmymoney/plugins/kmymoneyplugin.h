/**
 * This class describes the interface between KMyMoney and it's plugins.

 * The plugins are based on Qt 5's plugin system. So you must compile json information into the plugin.
 * KMyMoney looks into the folder "${PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR}/kmymoney/" and loads all plugins found there (if the user did not deactivate the plugin).
 *
 * The json header of the plugin must comply with the requirements of KCoreAddon's KPluginMetaData class.
 * To load the plugin at start up the service type "KMyMoney/Plugin" must be set.
 *
 * @warning The plugin system for KMyMoney 5 is still in development. Especially the loading of the on-demand plugins (mainly undocumented :( ) will change.
 *
 * A basic json header is shown below.
