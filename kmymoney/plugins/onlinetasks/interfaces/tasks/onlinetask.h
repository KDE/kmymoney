/**
 * @brief Enables onlineTask meta system
 *
 * Use ONLINETASK_META in your onlineTask derived class to create an onlineTask type iid
 * (the name). This is should be like the plugin iid of Qt5 (ONLINATASK_META was written
 * for Qt4).
 *
 * Given this code
 * @code
   onlineTask* taskA = // unknown;
   onlineTaskB *taskB = new onlineTaskB;
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following constrains are used by KMyMoney:
 * - @c taskA->taskName() == onlineTaskA::name() => dynamic_cast<onlineTaskA*>()
 * - @c dynamic_cast<onlineTaskC*>(taskB) == 0 => taskB->taskName() != onlineTaskC::name()
 *
 * @param onlineTaskSubClass the class type (e.g. onlineTask)
 * @param IID A unique name for the task, should be replaced by IID of Qt5 plugins
 *
 * \section onlineTaskMeta The onlineTask Meta System
 *
 * To prevent accidentally using a super-class if sub-class should be used, the onlineTasks
 * have a meta system. Each onlineTask has an iid which can be requested with a virtual
 * method or a static method.
 *
 * The task @b IID (type @c QString) is constant (even after a restart) and set by the programmer.
 * \code
 * // get the name of a known type
 * onlineTask::name()
 * // get the name of a pointer
 * onlineTask* unknownTask = new onlineTaskSubClass();
 * unknownTask->taskName();
 * \endcode
 *
 * Activate the meta system using ONLINETASK_META() in your classes public section.

/**
 * @brief Base class for tasks which can be proceeded by online banking plugins
 *
 * @notice This docu describes the intended way of the onlineTask/Job system. The loading during runtime or plugin
 * infrastructure is not realized yet (and needs further changes at the storage). The docu is just forward compatible.
 *
 * Everything an online plugin can do is represented as a task. But also imported data can be represented by an
 * onlineTask.
 *
 * Due to the huge amount of possible onlineTasks they are loaded during runtime. Which also allows a third party
 * online plugin to introduce its own tasks. However tasks are separated from the onlinePlugins to allow more than one
 * plugin to use the same task. Usually you will have an interface and an implementation (which derives from the
 * interface) to enable this.
 *
 * As user of an online Task you use @r onlineJobAdministration::createOnlineJob() to create a task (within an
 * onlineJob).
 *
 * The widgets to edit an onlineTask are created by subclassing @a IonlineJobEdit. To enable KMyMoney to convert
 * one task into another use @a onlineTaskConverter.
 *
 * @important Do not delete onlineTasks or use pointers to onlineTasks directly. Use @r onlineJob or @r onlineJobTyped instead!
 * This prevents common C++ pitfalls.
 *
 * If you inherit onlineTask, take care of clone() and @ref onlineTaskMeta.
 * Maybe you want to look at @ref onlineTask::settings as well.
