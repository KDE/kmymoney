<title>The Accounts View</title>

<para>
  The Accounts view provides a summary of all the accounts. It is similar to the
  Institutions view, except accounts are grouped under the Asset and Liability
  asset categories.  Typical asset accounts include bank accounts, cash, and
  investments, while typical liability accounts include credit cards and loans.
</para>

<para>
  There are actually two other account categories: Income and
  Expense. Categories are a way to organize your transaction; they are grouped
  under either the Income or Expense account category and are treated
  internally by &kmymoney; as accounts. They are described in more detail in
  the chapter on <link linkend="details.categories">Categories</link>. The
  Income and Expense account categories are always displayed in the Categories
  view, but it is possible to <link linkend="details.settings">configure
  &kmymoney;</link> to also display them on the Accounts view.

  click on the <guibutton>New Institution</guibutton> button.  This will bring
  up the New Institution Dialog, as described in the previous section.  If this
  is not a bank account, or if you do not want to use online banking, you do not
  need to specify an institution.

<title>Investment Accounts</title>

<para>
  In &kmymoney;, Investment accounts contain only equities (stocks, bonds,
  &etc;) but do not contain cash.  (This is why you cannot specify a Opening
  balance for an Investment account.)  If a transaction in an Investment account
  requires or generates cash (such as to buy or sell stock,) a Brokerage account
  is used for the cash.  Brokerage accounts are described further in the chapter
  on <link linkend="details.investments">Investments</link>.  When you create a
  new Investment account, after entering the basic information, and clicking
  <guibutton>Next</guibutton>, you have the option to create an associated
  Brokerage account.

<para>
  It is generally best to create the Brokerage account here, which will be given
  the same name as the Investment account, with "(Brokerage)" appended.
  Currently it is not possible to specify the opening date or balance for the
  Brokerage account at this point; you may do by editing the account details
  after the account has been created.

<title>Loan Accounts</title>

<para>
  Loan accounts are special accounts used to help you manage Loans with interest
  and scheduled repayments.  By providing &kmymoney; with information about the
  loan, &kmymoney; can help you track interest payments and the remaining
  principal of the loan.

</para>
	
<para>
  On the Details page you enter the general information about the loan.
</para>

<para>
  First, select whether you are borrowing or lending money.  If you are
  borrowing money the loan will be listed in Accounts under Liabilities.  If you
  are lending money the loan will be listed under Assets.
</para>
	
<para>
  Next, select the payee or payer of the loan.  As always, if the name doesn't
  yet exist in the Payees list, enter it here and &kmymoney; will create it for
  you.
</para>

<para>
  The next three items are for handling Loans on which you've already made
  payments.  If you select Yes in the <guilabel>"Did you make/receive any
  payments yet?"</guilabel> dropdown, you can then select whether you want to
  record all payments or just those from the beginning of the current year.  If
  you want to record from the beginning of the current year, you are than asked
  to input the balance at the beginning of this year.
</para>
	
<para>
  Next, select how often payments will be made and how often interest is
  compounded.  Compounding is where the interest is added to the amount owed on
  the loan so that when the interest is next calculated there will be more
  interest paid on the interest.  It's common for interest to be compounded at
  the same frequency that payments are made.
</para>

<para>
  Next, enter the date the first payment to be recorded.
</para>
	
<para>
  Finally, enter information about how the interest rate varies.  If the loan is
  fixed-rate there is nothing to do.  If the rate varies, select Variable in
  <guilabel>"Type of interest rate"</guilabel> and then enter the interval
  between interest rate changes and the date the first change of interest rate
  is due: &kmymoney; will ask you to update the interest rate when that date
  arrives.  Click <guibutton>Next</guibutton> to continue.

  <varlistentry>
    <term>Balloon payment</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Additional final payment made at the end of the term to pay off the
        remaining principal of the loan.  For a repayment loan this is often
        zero.  For an interest-only loan this will be the same as the loan
        amount.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
  Finally, use the <guibutton>Calculate</guibutton> button to check the values
  you have entered.  You must have entered either all or all but one of the
  values listed above.  If you omit two or more values the button is disabled
  because it is not possible to check that the entered values are consistent: in
  that case you will not be able to use the Loan account facility in &kmymoney;
  and will instead have to use a Liability or Asset account to track the loan
  manually.
</para>
	
<para>
  If you omit one value, &kmymoney; will try to calculate it for you.  If you
  have entered all values &kmymoney; will check the values are consistent.
  &kmymoney; will not adjust entered values other than the "Balloon payment",
  which it may adjust slightly to deal with rounding.  If the values are
  inconsistent or &kmymoney; cannot calculate the omitted value, &kmymoney; will
  let you know so that you can correct any errors and repeat the calculation.
</para>

<para>
  Once the values are consistent, the <guibutton>Next</guibutton> button is
  enabled and you can advance to the next page.

  the ledger. Next, find the account in the accounts view and after right
  clicking on the entry to show the popup menu select <guimenuitem>Delete
  account...</guimenuitem> from the popup menu.
</para>

  If you are unable to delete an account which looks like it has no transactions
  in it, check your filter. See <menuchoice> <guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Configure &kmymoney;</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>General</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Filter</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice>. Clear all filters. Set the start date to 1.1.1900 or so.

  There may be transactions in your ledger that are not shown, for example, if
  you have inadvertently typed in the wrong year when making an entry so that an
  entry remains outside the opening date of &kmymoney;. This appears beneath the
  ledger page as remaining funds.
