<title>Currencies</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; supports the use of multiple currencies in different accounts. For
  example, you can set up a bank account in Euros, another in British Pounds, and
  still have your credit card account in US Dollars.
</para>

<sect1 id="details.currencies.basecurrency">
<title>Base currency</title>

<para>
  During the initial &kmymoney; <link linkend="firsttime.3">New File
  Setup</link>, you will be asked to select the base currency.  Usually, the
  base currency is the currency you use in your country.  The base currency is
  the one that all income and expense categories use and that reports will be
  based on. When you set up a new account, &kmymoney; will automatically default
  to the base currency.  If your account requires you to use a different
  currency, you can change it during the <link
  linkend="details.accounts.create">New Account Setup.</link>

<sect2 id="details.currencies.newcurrency">
<title>Adding a new currency</title>

<para>
  Although it does not happen often, sometimes a new currency is introduced.
  This can be a new virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, or a change introduced by
  a country for financial policy reasons.  While any such currency will be added
  to the next version of &kmymoney; it is possible to add it manually, in case
  you have a need to begin using it immediately.
</para>

<para>
  To manually add a currency, select the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Currencies...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item to display the <guilabel>Currencies</guilabel> dialog, as shown
  above. Either click on the <guibutton>+ Add</guibutton> button or right click
  on any existing currency and select <guimenuitem>New currency</guimenuitem>
  from the <guimenu>Currency Options</guimenu> context menu.  That will bring up
  a dialog where you can enter the ISO Code, Name, and other details about the
  currency.  When you are ready, click <guilabel>OK</guilabel>.  The currency
  will be created with the specified name.  To change the name or other details
  later, click the <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button.  You can also change the
  name by either pressing <keycap>F2</keycap> or right clicking the currency and
  selecting <guimenuitem>Rename currency</guimenuitem>.
</para>

<sect1 id="details.currencies.accountsetup">
<title>Account setup</title>

<para>
  When you create a new account, you specify the currency in which it will be
  managed.  The New Account wizard defaults this setting to the <link
  linkend="details.currencies.basecurrency">base currency</link>.  If you
  require a different currency, you need to select it during this initial setup.
  The ledger for the account will then show all values in the selected currency.
  You cannot change the currency of an account once the account has been
  created.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.currencies.transactions">
<title>Entering transactions using different currencies</title>

<para>
  Whenever a transaction is entered that refers to more than one currency, which
  includes using a currency other than the default currency of the account, the
  exchange rate editor pops up and allows you to enter an exchange rate to be
  used for that transaction.  Initially, the current price available from the
  price database will be used as exchange rate.  See <link
  linkend="details.currencies.prices">Entering exchange rates for
  currencies</link> for more information on how to provide exchange rates
  manually and obtain online price information.
</para>

<para>
  Optionally, the exchange rate is saved in the price database once entered by
  the user.

<title>Entering prices manually</title>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Price Editor</guilabel> allows you to enter exchange rates
  between currencies or prices for investments.  You can pull it up using the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Prices...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item.

</para>

<para>
  In &kmymoney; a <quote>Price</quote> is the cost of one currency in terms of a
  second currency.  For example, as I write this, the price of 1 USD in terms of
  1 EUR is 0.83; that is, 1 USD costs 0.83 EUR.  The first currency is the one
  being bought or sold, and the second one is the currency used to buy or sell
  it.
</para>

<para>
  When you press the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button, you get the
  <guilabel>New Price Entry</guilabel> dialog.  Enter the first currency (USD in
  the example above) in the Security field.  Enter the second currency (EUR in
  the example above) in the Currency field.  Enter the effective date of the
  price in the Date field.

<title>Online currency updates</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; can fetch currency conversions from the web.  Once you have entered
  a single price for a pair of currencies, the online quote feature will always
  list that pair among its options.
