<title>Currencies</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; supports the use of multiple currencies in different accounts.  For
  example, you can set up a savings account in Euros, a checking account in British
  Pounds, and still have your credit card account in US Dollars.
</para>

<sect1 id="details.currencies.basecurrency"><title>Base currency</title>
<para>
  During the initial &kmymoney; <link linkend="firsttime.newfile"> New File
  Setup</link>, you are asked to select the base currency.  Usually, the base
  currency is the currency you use in your home country.  The base currency is the
  one that all income and expense categories use and that reports will be based on.
  When you set up a new account, &kmymoney; will automatically default to the base
  currency.  If your account requires you to use a different currency, you can change
  it during the <link linkend="details.accounts.create.account">New Account
  Setup</link>.
</para>

<para>
  &kmymoney; is released with a list of all currencies known at the time, and that is
  the list from which you chose the default currency when you created your data file.
  The <guilabel>Currencies</guilabel> dialog is where you manage the list of
  currencies used in your data file.  To display this dialog, select the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Currencies...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item.

<para>
  For a newly created data file, the Currencies dialog will show only the currency
  you chose as the default currency.  If you want to use a different currency for a
  new account, you must first add that currency.  By clicking
  <guibutton>Add</guibutton>, you will be presented with the same list of currencies
  from which you chose the default currency.  You can either scroll through the list
  or use the search box at the top to find the currency you wish to use.  Click that
  currency, and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  The Currencies dialog will then
  include that currency in the list displayed, and you can now select that currency
  when creating a new account.

<para>
  Although it does not happen often, sometimes a new currency is introduced.  This
  can be a new virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, or a change introduced by a country
  for financial policy reasons.  While any such currency will be added to the next
  version of &kmymoney;, it is possible to add it to your data file manually, in case
  you have a need to begin using it immediately.
</para>

<para>
  To manually add a currency, bring up the Currencies dialog, as shown above.
  Right-click any existing currency and select <guimenuitem>New
  currency</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Currency Options</guimenu> context menu,
  or click <guibutton>New</guibutton>.  This will bring up the <guilabel>Currency
  editor</guilabel>.

<sect1 id="details.currencies.transactions"><title>Entering transactions using different currencies</title>
<para>
  Whenever a transaction is entered that refers to more than one currency, the
  exchange rate editor pops up and allows you to enter an exchange rate.  Initially,
  the most recent price available from the price database will be used as the
  exchange rate.  See <link linkend="details.currencies.prices">Entering exchange
  rates for currencies</link> for more information on how to provide exchange rates
  manually and obtain online price information.
</para>

<para>
  Optionally, the exchange rate is saved in the price database once entered by the
  user.
</para>

<sect2><title>Entering prices manually</title>
<para>
  The <guilabel>Price Editor</guilabel>, also called the price database editor,
  allows you to enter or modify prices for both investments and exchange rates
  between currencies.  You can pull it up using the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Prices...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item.

<para>
  The first column in the dialog is labelled <guilabel>Commodidty</guilabel>, which
  displays both trading symbols of securites and the symbols of currencies.  In
  &kmymoney;, a <quote>Price</quote> is the price of security in terms of a currency,
  or of a currency in terms of a second currency.  For example, as I write this, the
  price of 1 USD in terms of 1 EUR is 0.94; that is, 1 USD costs 0.94 EUR.  The first
  currency is the one being bought or sold, and the second one is the currency used
  to buy or sell it.
</para>

<para>
  To manually enter a new exchange rate, press the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button,
  and you get the New Price Entry dialog.

<para>
  Enter the first currency (USD in the example above) in the Security field.
  Enter the second currency (EUR in the example above) in the Currency field.  Enter
  the effective date of the price in the Date field.
</para>

<para>
  Press the <guilabel>OK</guilabel> button, and you will then see the
  <guilabel>Exchange Rate/Price Editor</guilabel> dialog.

<para>
  You can specify a price in two ways.  You can enter the <guilabel>To
  amount</guilabel> or total price of the first currency in terms of the second, or
  you can enter the actual Exchange rate.  In this case, since you are entering the
  number of EUR for 1 USD, those two values are the same.  However, this is the same
  dialog used to enter an exchage rate when you enter a transaction which involves
  two currencies.  In that case, you will generally enter the amount, and let
  &kmymoney; calculate the exachange rate, taking care of any rounding.
</para>

<sect2><title>Online currency updates</title>
<para>
  &kmymoney; can fetch currency conversion rates from the web.  Once you have
  entered a single price for a pair of currencies, the online quote feature will
  always list that pair amongst its options.
