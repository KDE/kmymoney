<title>The Ledgers View</title>

<para>
  The Ledgers View is functionally the data integration center of &kmymoney;.  This
  view is for entering, examining, editin, and deleting transactions in your defined
  accounts.  This veiw has had a major overaul since the 5.1 series of &kmymoney;
  releases.  The main difference is that it is now a tabbed display, so you can have
  more than one account displayed at once.  You can actually only see one at a time,
  but switching by simply clicking on a different tab is significantly more
  convenient than having to select the other account in a dropdown.
</para>
  
<para>
  The main display area shows zero or more tabs, each one for the ledger display on
  one account.  The rightmost tab will always have a <guilabel>+</guilabel>.
  Clicking on this will display a dropdown where you can select the account to view,
  and a new tab will be created for that account.  The rest of this chapter will
  descirbe using the ledger for any single account.
</para>

<para>
  The Ledgers View allows for several key actions: searching and viewing
  transactions; entering new transaction; and editing, duplicating, deleting, and
  scheduling existing transactions.  Along with this it also provides the ability to
  move, mark, and go to additional account transaction details.  Other functionality
  within the Ledgers View includes modifying and reconciling the account.

</para>

<para>
  In previous versions of &kmymoney;, the filter area was always displayed at the top
  of the ledger.  Now, it is normally hidden, but can be displayed by typing
  <keycombo>&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.  It will then appear below the
  transaction list.  At the left of the filter area is a small <quote>x</quote> in a
  red circle.<!-- FIXME: use actual icon --> Clicking on this icon will clear any
  filters in place and hide the filter area.
</para>

<para>
  Previous versions of &kmymoney; had a dropdown where you could select the account
  to be displayed in the ledger.  This is no longer necessary, as to view another
  account, you can just open a new tab.
</para>

<para>
  If displayed, most of the filter area is a text entry area. Typing in this filter
  box will cause &kmymoney; to display only transactions containing the text typed in
  the box.  The text specified can be in any of the fields of the transaction for the
  displayed account.  At the right end of the filter box is a small
  <quote>x</quote> in a black box.<!-- FIXME: use actual icon --> Clicking this icon
  will clear any text in the filter box.
</para>

<para>
  At the right of the text entry is a status filter dropdown.  The default value is
  <guilabel>Any status</guilabel> which does not apply any filter to the list.  The
  other values allow you to restrict the list of displayed transactions to those
  which are <guilabel>Imported</guilabel>, <guilabel>Matched</guilabel>,
  <guilabel>Erroneous</guilabel>, <guilabel>Not marked</guilabel>, <guilabel>Not

</para>
</formalpara>
	
<para>
  After a transaction has been entered, it is displayed in the transaction list.  You
  can also change transaction properties or even create new transactions directly in
  the list.  In the transactions list, the default order of transactions is sorted by
  transaction date, with the most recent transaction on the bottom.  Clicking on the
  header of the transaction list brings up a dialog box that will allow the ability
  to change the sort order of the transactions.  For instructions on how to change
  the default sort order, see the <link
  linkend="details.settings.register.sorting">Sorting tab</link> section of the <link
  linkend="details.settings">&kmymoney; Settings</link> Chapter.
</para>

<para>
  Note that altering the sort order can be useful in special circumstances, but for
  many sort orders, especiallyl where the transaction date is not the first sort key,
  the balance column will not be very meaningful, and will almost certainly not match
  the balance of any statement or display by the bank or institution.
</para>

<para>
  In previous versions of &kmymoney; you needed to right-click on a column header to
  change the sort order.  Now, right-clicking allows you to toggle display of the
  optional columns, and you need to left-click to change the sort order.
</para>

<para>
  At the bottom of the transaction list, &kmymoney; displays three values:
</para>

<formalpara><title>Last reconciliation</title>
<para>
  This is the most recent date when you reconciled this account.  Reconciliation is
  an important process for many accounts, and is described <link
  linkend="details.reconcile">here</link>.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Cleared</title>
<para>
  This is the total of all cleared and reconciled transactions in this account.
  See <link linkend="details.ledgers.cleared">this section</link> for more
  information about the cleared and reconciled states of transactions.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Balance</title>
<para>
  This is where &kmymoney; displays the current balance of the account, which is the
  sum of all transactions in the account.  However, if you select more than one
  transaction in the transaction list, this changes to display the sum of the
  selected transactions.  This returns to the balance when no transactions or only
  one transaction is selected.
</para>
</formalpara>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>The transaction form</title>

<para>
  Whether or not the transaction form is displayed at the bottom area of the Ledger
  View depends on your configuration and the type of account being displayed.
  However, if present, it generally includes fields for all the details of a single
  transaction, as well as buttons for various actions that can apply to a
  transaction.  It is described in more detail in the following sections.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.ledger.transactions">
<title>Entering Transactions</title>

<para>
  There are two methods of entering transactions into the ledger: using the
  transaction form or entering the data directly into the transaction list.  The
  transaction form is displayed by default and this is the method we will discuss
  first.  Turning off the transaction form can be accomplished by going to the Ledger
  section in the Configure &kmymoney; that's within the Settings.
  <!-- FIXME: use a proper link -->
</para>

<para>
  The fields in the input area match the information fields in the transaction list.
  Additional fields include the Memo field, for a more detailed description of the
  transaction, and a Category selection. The Split button allows you to split the
  transaction into multiple categories.
  <!-- FIXME: use specific link to discussion of split transaction -->

<para>
  The transaction form at the bottom of the ledger view is the interface for manually
  creating transactions.
</para>

<para>
  Note that the layout of the transaction form has been revised in &kmymoney; 5.2.
  Whether a new transaction is a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer is determined by
  the data you enter in the amount and category fields, you do not need to choose a
  specific tab or specify To: or From:.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>The fields of a transaction</title>

<para>
  Enter the information using the following notes on the available fields.  Note that
  many fields have <quote>Auto Completion</quote> turned on.  That is, if you start
  typing, &kmymoney; will offer alternatives matching the characters you begin to
  enter.  To select the matching content simply click on the entry by using your
  mouse or selecting the appropriate keyboard keys.  If the entry is not listed
  finish typing the content to add the new value.  The next time you type the
  content, &kmymoney; will find it for you as you begin to enter the initial
  characters.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>Payer/Payee</title>

<para>
  This is who the money comes from or goes to.  If the payee is a new entry
  &kmymoney; will ask if you wish to add this to the list of Payees.  Any other
  information related to a payee or payer, such as address, phone number and account
  number as well as notes can be updated in the Payees View.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Category</title>

<para>
  This specifies an income or expense category for accounting and reporting purposes,
  and enables you to group certain transactions.  Type the name of the category into
  the defined field.  If you have entered the category and it does not exist then
  &kmymoney; will ask if you want to create a new one.  If you select
  <guilabel>Yes</guilabel> &kmymoney; will then open a dialog box that allows for the
  further definition of the category based on General, Hierarchy, and Tax
  characteristics.
</para>

<para>
  For Transfer transactions, you select the other account in the Category field.
</para>

<para>
  If you wish to associate parts of the transaction with different categories,
  &kmymoney; can handle this need.  An example might be a cash withdrawal of 50 of
  which you use 10 on food, 20 on beer, and 20 as cash.  The transaction will
  therefore be assigned three categories: Food, Beer, and Cash.  To do this, you need
  to use <link linkend="details.ledgers.split">Split Transactions</link>, which is
  described in more detail below.
</para>

<para>
  See the special <link linkend="reference.widgets">&kmymoney; fields</link>
  section for more information on how to use this field.
  <!-- FIXME: probably need better link to explanation of split transactions -->
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Tags</title>

<para>
  Tags are similar to Categories, and can be used to maintain an orthogonal view to
  Categories.  They provide the ability to group transactions within a Category based
  on your defined needs.  This need could be defined by a specifics to Person, Place,
  or Thing.  For example, you might have a Category for each different type of
  automotive expenses, and then have a Tag for each vehicle.  As with Categories, you
  can select from the dropdown list, or type a new Tag name, and be prompted if you
  want to create a new Tag with that name.  Within the Tag field &kmymoney; will
  allow for multiple tags entered within a single transaction.  Also, you can enter
  tags on an individual split.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Memo</title>

<para>
  A single or multi-line memo can be entered if you wish to record any further
  details of the transaction.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Number</title>

<para>
  The transaction number can be entered if needed.  Note that the check number field
  can be made visible or invisible in the ledger list if desired.  This is configured
  in the Ledger Settings dialog.  While this is most commonly used for a Check Number
  in a Checking account, it can be used in any type of account, in any way you might
  want to number your transactions.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Date</title>

<para>
  The transaction's date must be entered to specify when the transaction took place.
  See the special <link linkend="reference.widgets">&kmymoney; fields</link> section
  for more information on how the date input field can be used to make entering dates
  quicker and easier.  For transactions in checking and credit card accounts, it is
  your choice whether to use the actual date (when you wrote the check or made the
  purchase) or the posting date as reported by the bank or credit card company.
  Using the actual date can help you track when you made the purchase, for example,
  but the statement or downloaded data from the bank is more likely to use the
  posting date.  &kmymoney; automatically keeps the date the transaction was entered
  into the ledger, but this is in a different field, which is optionally displayed in
  the ledger list.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Amount</title>

<para>
  Finally, enter the transaction amount into either the <guilabel>Paymenet</guilabel>
  or <guilabel>Deposit</guilabel> field.  Note that a simple calculator can be
  displayed, either by clicking the icon to the right of the field, or by entering
  the % character into the field, or by entering any of these mathematical symbols: +
  - * / in a formula, as in <emphasis>12 + 3</emphasis>.  When entering the plus
  sign, the calculator will be opened.  Note that only the final result of any
  calculation will be saved as the Payment or Deposit amount of the transaction.
</para>

<para>
  When you are satisfied that all the fields have been adequately filled in, click on
  <guibutton>Enter</guibutton>.  If you accidentally press or click on
  <guibutton>Enter</guibutton> before you have finished entering all the data, click
  on <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> to resume entering the data.

  The second method of entering transactions into the ledger involves creating and

  <!-- FIXME: confirm this is right.  It looks to me like new entry is always in the
       form, although the form is shown at the "correct" position in the ledger, not at
       the bottom. -->
  To do this you must first let &kmymoney; know that you don't want to use the
  transaction form.  This is done by selecting the <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Configure &kmymoney;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item and
  selecting the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
  fileref="ledgers_view.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
  </guiicon> register icon from the list on the left.  The option to uncheck is
  labeled <guilabel>Show transaction form</guilabel>.  When finished click on
  <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to be ready to directly enter or edit transactions.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Starting the edit</title>

<para>	
  To enter a new transaction into the ledger, you can either click on the empty entry
  at the bottom of the ledger list, press <keycombo
  action="simul">&Ctrl;&Ins;</keycombo>, or select the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Transaction</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>New transaction...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item.  To edit an
  existing transaction, the &Up; and &Down; arrow keys let you navigate through the
  list.  After pressing &Enter; or double-clicking on an entry, the transaction list
  displays the fields required to enter or edit the transaction.
  <!-- FIXME: should we just say this is the floating transaction for or the
       transaction form appears at the location of the transaction in the list
       instead of at the bottom of the list? -->
</para>

<para>
  To move through the fields press the &Tab; key and when done press &Enter; to save
  the changes or &Esc; to cancel.
</para>

<para>
  In case the option <guilabel>Use Enter to move between fields</guilabel> is
  selected, the &Enter; key moves to the next field just as the &Tab; key except for
  the last entry field where it saves the data.
</para>

<para>
  Which method you use to enter transactions is up to you and is a matter of personal
  preference.  As with many applications, there are almost always multiple ways to
  accomplish any particular task.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.ledgers.split">
<title id="details.ledgers.split.title">Split Transactions</title>

<para>
  The split transaction feature allows you to divide up a transaction into multiple
  categories, representing, for example, the different types of items bought with a
  single purchase at a store.
</para>

<!-- FIXME: Need to note you cas assign a payee in the split editor, and it (?) shows
     up in the memo columne, which needs to be fixed.
     Also need to mention th new buttons: Merge, Delete (different from Delete 0 -->

<para>
  A transaction always contains one or more splits.  Each split represents money
  moving into or out of a sigle account.
  <!-- FIXME: Is there somewhere else this can refer to which explains in any more
       detail what can and can't be split, and the possibility of a transaction with
       only one split for adding or removing shares.  We also need a place to
       explaint currency conversion, and how it relates to currencies. -->
  Most of the time, a transaction contains exactly two splits, one for the account
  the money is coming from and the other for the account the money is going to.  The
  term <quote>Split Transaction</quote> is used when one side of the transaction is
  further divided into more than one split.  This is most commonly done when money
  moves in or out of a typical bank account, but is allocated to more than one
  category.
</para>

<para>
  To enter a split transaction, using either the transaction form or the transaction
  list, start a new transaction, including entering the total amount.  Then, instead
  of selecting a category, click the <guibutton>Split</guibutton><!-- FIXME: use
  actual icon --> button to the right of the <guilabel>Category</guilabel> field.  If
  you have already selected a category, that becomes the first entry in the split
  editor screen.
</para> 
 
<para>
  In the split editor screen, double-click an empty line to enter a new split or
  sub-transaction or press <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Ins;</keycombo>. Specify
  the category, add an (optional) memo, and enter the amount. To save this part of
  the split, press the green check mark under the category. To cancel, press the red
  cross.<!-- FIXME:  the check and cross are in the second below shot, not the one
  immediately below.  Can we make this description closer to it's picture? -->
</para> 
 
<para>
  After entering a split, the bottom of the split editor shows how much of the total
  transaction is still unassigned. After entering all the splits, press the
  <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to save the entire transaction. If there is still
  an unassigned amount, you will be prompted to either return to editing the splits,
  change the total transaction amount, or leave part of the transaction
  unassigned. <!-- FIXME: Have the check and cross been replaced with OK and Cancel
  buttons? -->

<title id="details.ledgers.match.title">Matching Transactions</title>

<para>
  Generally, when you import transactions, either via QIF, OFX, or HBCI, &kmymoney;
  will automatically attempt to match them against existing transactions.  To allow
  for differences in the dates, there is a default setting of 4 days, which may be
  changed in the settings - Register/Import. <!-- FIXME: make proper link --> Any
  transactions so matched will be highlighted in green. <!-- FIXME: confirm the color
  highlight --> On completion of the import, you should review these and either
  accept or unmatch them.
</para>

<para>
  If you find that an imported transaction was not automatically matched with an
  existing transaction when it should have matched, then it is possible to match them
  manually.  Note there is a difference between manually matching two transactions
  and simply deleting one of them, even though they may appear to have the same
  effect.  Specifically with OFX or HBCI, it is important not to delete the imported
  transaction, because you will find that the next time you import your transactions,
  the deleted transaction may show up again.  This is because modern import formats
  like OFX and HBCI use a <quote>Transaction ID</quote> to identify transactions.
  When you delete the imported transaction, the transaction ID goes with it, so the
  importer has no way to know this transaction was already imported.
</para> 

<para>
  If this happens, the solution is to tell &kmymoney; that the transactions are the
  same, using the manual matching interface.  This allows you to match an imported
  transaction with a hand-entered (non-imported) transaction.  To do so, select one
  of the transactions to be matched by clicking on it, then select the other by left
  clicking on it while pressing the <keycap>&Ctrl;</keycap> key, and then select
  <guimenuitem>Match</guimenuitem> from the context menu.  This will match and
  combine the two transactions.  The values of both transactions must be the
  same for the match to work, except that the dates may differ by the window
  specified in the settings, as described above.
</para> 

<para>
  <!-- FIXME: get screenshot and confirm this description -->
  Since the value is the only field in the two transaction which must absolutely be
  the same, the value of other fields may differ.  When you select
  <guilabel>Match</guilabel>, you will see a <guilabel>Match Transactions</guilabel>
  dialog.  This dialog allows you to choose which of the two transactions is used as

  transactions is imported, the date of that transactoin will always be used in the
  matched transaction, even if all other fields are taken from the non-imported
  transaction.

  If you are happy with the status of the match dialog, right-click the matched
  transaction, then select <guibutton>Accept</guibutton>.<!-- where do you really right-click,

  During import of online statements, either directly or by importing a downloaded
  file, &kmymoney; performs matching as best as it can based on the name of the payee
  and the amount of the transaction.  In case of an invalid match, a matched
  transaction can be unmatched.

<note>
  <para>
    The matching interface will not allow you to match two transactions which have
    both been imported.  Likewise, it also will not allow matching between two
    transactions which have both been entered by hand.

<title>Understanding the State of a transaction</title>

<para>
  The process of reconciling accounts is discussed <link
  linkend="details.reconcile">later in the handbook</link>.  For now, it is only
  important to know that transaction can have one of three states: non-reconciled
  (blank), cleared (C), or reconciled (R).  When a transaction is entered, it has
  state of non-reconciled.  Once the bank posts the transaction, the user can mark it
  as cleared and thus transform it to state (C).

</para>

<para>
  When you receive a statement from the bank, all cleared transactions should be on
  the statement.  When you reconcile your account, you confirm that the transactions
  marked Cleared and the transactions listed on the statement are the same, and that
  the difference between the beginning balance and the cleared transactions equals
  the ending balance of the statement.  When this is the case, you can 'finish
  reconciling' which changes the state of all cleared (C) transactions prior to the
  date of reconciliation to reconciled (R).
</para>

<para>
  If you try to edit a transaction with at least one split marked as reconciled (R),
  you will be warned.  There is a further discussion about why this is important in
  the section on Reconciliation.  about
