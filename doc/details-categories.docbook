<title>Categories</title>

<para>
  The Categories view provides a summary of all the existing categories in your
  current database.  The categories are split into income and expense, sorted
  alphabetically, and shown along with the respective balance for each.

<title>Creating a category</title>

<para>
  There are 3 ways to create a new category: either select the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Category</guimenu><guimenuitem>New
  category</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item; select a parent in the tree
  in the Categories view, right-click and select the <guimenuitem>New
  Category</guimenuitem> option, or directly type the name of the new category
  when adding or editing a transaction in the Ledger.  Doing any of these steps
  will direct you to the <guilabel>Create new Category</guilabel> dialog.  The
  dialog contains three tabs: <guilabel>General</guilabel>,
  <guilabel>Hierarchy</guilabel>, and <guilabel>Tax</guilabel>.  The General tab
  includes editable fields for the new category name, type, and currency (with
  the default currency preselected,) as well as options for Last check number,
  Notes, and a checkbox for Cost center assignment required.  In the Hierarchy
  tab, you are able to select the appropriate parent account for the category.
  Finally, in the Tax tab, there are fields to enable and configure VAT support,
  and a checkbox to include this category in tax related reports.

<sect1 id="details.categories.edit">
<title>Editing a Category</title>

<para>
  To edit a category, right-click on a category name, and choose
  <guimenuitem>Edit category</guimenuitem>.  A window appears with the same
  three tabs as the new category dialog: General, Hierarchy and Tax.  Each tab
  allows you to edit certain details of the category.
</para>

<para>
  The General tab allows you to edit the name of the category, any notes you
  entered when you created the category, the Last check number, and the state of
  the Cost Center assignment required checkbox.  The Type, Currency, and Price
  entry cannot be changed from their initial values.
</para>

<!-- not ported to kde4 yet, much less Frameworks.  Uncomment once that is done.
     See https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272737 
     You can also change the parent category from the main category page by
     dragging the category to a different parent. -->
  The Hierarchy tab allows you to change the parent category by clicking on
  another category in this view of the category hierarchy.  In an earlier
  version of &kmymoney; it was possible to change the parent of a category by
  dragging and dropping.  This functionality is expected to return in a future
  version of the application.
</para>

<para>
  The Tax tab allows you to assign or change VAT details, or to alter the
  automatic VAT assignment.  It also allows the ability to toggle whether or not
  the category is included in tax related reports.

<title>VAT Support</title>
	
<para>
  You can turn an expense/income category into a VAT category, which means that
  it receives all the splits that actually make up the VAT payment towards the
  government. You can also enter a specific percentage rate.
</para>
 
<para>
  Categories can be assigned a VAT category, which allows &kmymoney; to split a
  transaction for a category into two parts, one for the category and one for
  the VAT. Depending on the setting of the gross/net amount switch, the amount
  you enter for the transaction is the gross or net amount.
</para>
 
<para>
  Example: In Germany, there are three VAT percentages (0%, 7%, and 19%). So I
  have a main category "VAT paid" and three subcategories, one for each
  percentage rate. I create these on both the income and the expense sides so
  that I have six categories in total.  For the goods I buy, I select one of
  the above mentioned categories as the "VAT category assignment".
</para>
 
<para>
  When I buy goods, I enter them into a transaction. Let's assume I have
  selected the gross amount entry method, once I enter the category and amount,
  &kmymoney; will recognize that there's a VAT assignment and calculate the VAT
  part, create a second split with the VAT account and VAT amount and reduce the
  category amount.
</para>
 
<para>
  The same applies to income categories but the other way around. Hope that
  makes sense.

<sect1 id="details.categories.delete">
<title>Deleting a category</title>

<para>
  To delete a category, select it in the tree, right click to bring up the popup
  menu, and select <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem>.  If the category has no
  transactions, schedules, or budgets associated with it, and it is not set as the
  default category for new transactions with any payee, it will be deleted.
</para>

<para>
  If the category has any of those items, a popup will be displayed allowing you
  to choose another category to which all those items can be reassigned before
  the category is deleted.
</para>

<para>
  If you delete a category which is the parent of any other categories, a dialog
  will be displayed for you to choose whether to delete that category and all
  its sub-categories or just the parent category.  If you choose to just delete
  the parent category, then all its sub-categories will be moved to its parent
  category.
</para>

<para>
  Note that deleting some categories may prompt both for where to reassign its
  data and also whether or not to delete any sub-categories.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.categories.open_ledger">
<title>Open ledger for a category</title>

<para>
  By right-clicking on any category there is an option to open a ledger for that
  category.  You can also double-click on the category.  When this option is
  selected &kmymoney; will display a ledger with all the transactions for the
  selected category.  This allows you to quickly review all the transactions in
  detail for the selected category.  You can then right-click on any transaction
  to obtain additional details about the specific transaction ultimately allowing
  any editing that may be required.  Note that you cannot edit a transaction in
  the Category ledger; you need to switch to the ledger display for the other
  account, using one of the selections in the popup menu when you right click on
  the transaction.
