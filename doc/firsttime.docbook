<title>Creating a new file</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; keeps all the data about your finances in a file.  As was stated in
  <link linkend="makingmostof.basicaccounting.personalaccounts">Defining the
  accounts (personal records)</link>, you can keep more than one set of
  accounts, but the data for each will be kept in a separate file, and
  &kmymoney; can only have one file open at a time.  See the chapter on <link
  linkend="details.formats">File Formats</link> for more details about
  &kmymoney;'s data files.
</para>

<para>
  To create a new file you can either select
  <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item or choose the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
  fileref="new.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> new
  icon from the toolbar. In addition, if the main welcome page is displayed,
  you can also select the first link: "Get started and setup accounts."

  Since all fields are optional, you can use &kmymoney; without entering any
  information now.  Any information entered here is used only to personalize
  your file.  In the future, it may be used in some reports and for online
  banking. If &kmymoney; requires any personal information in future releases
  and finds none, you will be prompted to enter the relevant data then.
</para>

<para>
  Please enter your name and address or nothing and press
  <guibutton>Next</guibutton>.

  &kmymoney; supports multiple currencies.  To set your base currency (the

  Enter the name of the account and a possible account or reference number
  assigned by the institution managing the account.  Enter the opening date of
  the account and the opening balance of the account.  For example, you want to
  use &kmymoney; to manage all your finances as of 2008-01-01, then enter the
  balance of the account at the beginning of this date.  The number can possibly
  be obtained from a paper statement.  You may also enter the name and the bank
  code of the institution.  The latter, known as the routing number in the US or
  the sort code in the UK, is optional and only required for online banking
  purposes, but it may also be helpful when importing bank statements in some of
  the formats supported (OFX, QFX).

  idea to perform a backup.  Because the file used by &kmymoney; is a standard
  Unix file you can just copy the file to another location to back it up or use
  the dialog provided by &kmymoney;.  Using the dialog is the preferred method
  because if &kmymoney; ever starts using other file formats, such as SQL, then
  it would be much harder to copy the file manually.
</para>

<para>
  To backup your file through &kmymoney; Select
  <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Backup</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item and enter the folder where you wish the file to be saved. If the folder
  needs mounting first and you have the sufficient privileges then check the
  tick box labeled <guilabel>Mount this folder before backing up</guilabel>
  and click on <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
</para>

<para>
  The file will be saved to the folder specified with the current date appended
  to the filename so it is easy to see the date the file was backed up.

<sect1 id="firsttime.launch">
<title>Launching &kmymoney;</title>

<para>
  Most commonly, you will launch &kmymoney; from an icon or a start menu of your
  window manager.  In this case, the default behavior is that &kmymoney; will
  open the last file you had open.  However, in some circumstances, you will
  want or need to launch &kmymoney; from the command line.
</para>

<para>
  For a complete description of all the available command line options, see the
  man page for &kmymoney;.  However, there are two special cases which we
  describe here.
</para>

<formalpara><title><command>kmymoney -n</command></title>
  <para>
    The -n option tells &kmymoney; not to open the last file it had open.  This
    can be useful if the program crashes on startup.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title><command>kmymoney &lt;path to file&gt;</command></title>
  <para>
    Giving &kmymoney; a filename on the command line tells it to open that file
    instead of the last file it had open.  You can use the name of any valid
    &kmymoney; file, as described in the chapter on <link
    linkend="details.formats">file formats</link>.  In addition, this can be
    used to import a <link linkend="details.impexp.gnucash">&gnucash;</link> file.

<title>How to move &kmymoney; to a new computer</title>

<sect2 id="firsttime.newpc.data">
<title>Moving your data</title>

<para>
  If you get a new computer, it's very easy to move your data.  In fact, all you
  have to do is to copy your &kmymoney; data file.  The name of the file is
  shown in the title bar when &kmymoney; is running, it usually ends in <filename
  class="extension">.kmy</filename>. The first time you run the application on the
  new computer you will have to tell it where you have put the data file, either
  by running from the command line, or from the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
  menu item. You should even be able to move between &Windows;, &MacOS;, and &Linux; systems.
</para>

<para>
  If you have encrypted your data file, be sure the appropriate software and
  keys have also been set up on the new computer.
</para>

<para>
  If your data is in an SQL database, refer to documentation for your database
  software for guidance on migrating your data.
</para>

<para>
  Note that this assumes you have installed the same version of &kmymoney; on the new
  computer as you were running on the old computer.  Installing a newer version should
  also be safe, but you need to be aware of any issues related to that upgrade.  Any such
  issues should be noted in the release notes for the new version.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="firsttime.newpc.settings">
<title>Moving your settings</title>

<para>
  If you only move your data file to the new machine, as described in the
  previous section, &kmymoney; will work correctly, but you will have lost any
  settings you changed from the default on your old machine.  To maintain these
  settings, you also need to copy your configuration file.  This file is called
  <filename>kmymoneyrc</filename>. This file will be in a folder with other &kde;
  application configuration files. On a &Linux; system, this will be in
  <filename class="directory">$KDEHOME/share/config</filename> where <envar>$KDEHOME</envar> is usually
  <quote>.config</quote> within your home folder. If you are migrating from
  a version of &kmymoney; prior to 5.0 or later, the old location
  of <envar>$KDEHOME</envar> was <filename class="directory">.kde4</filename>.
</para>

<sect3 id="firsttime.newpc.settings.plugins">
<title>Moving plugin settings</title>

<para>
  If you have run any &kmymoney; plugin, such as the csv importer or exporter,
  it may also have created a configuration file in that same folder, such as
  <filename>csvimporterrc</filename> or <filename>csvexporterrc</filename>.
  These should also be copied to the new computer.
</para>

<para>
  As with the main data file, this assumes the same version of the plugin on
  both computers.  Upgrades are generally safe, but if the functionality of the
  plugin has changed greatly, it is advisable to carefully test using the old
  configuration file, to be sure the plugin behaves as you expect.
</para>

<para>
  Note that when upgrading from a previous version to version 5.0 or higher, the
  location of the template files used by the plugin for printing checks has
  changed.  Please consult the release notes or the project <ulink
  url="https://www.kmymoney.org/faq.php">website</ulink> for more details.
</para>

<note>
<para>
  These instructions are solely for moving your &kmymoney; data and settings.
  However, there may be important items which are stored by &kde; and not by
  &kmymoney;, such as passwords stored in kwallet.  Moving other parts of
  your &kde; setup is beyond the scope of this manual, although many of the
  relevant files are also stored under <envar>$KDEHOME</envar>.

<title>Reporting bugs</title>

<para>
  To report a bug please use the interface provided by &kmymoney; by selecting
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Report
  Bug</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item and filling in the required information.
  However, in case you have any difficulties with that method, you can report a
  bug (or file a wish-list or enhancement request) directly at the <ulink
  url="https://bugs.kde.org">&kde; bug reporting web site</ulink>.  Reports
  should be filed against the product <quote>kmymoney</quote>.
</para>

<para>
  In any case, before reporting a bug, please read through the guidelines below.
  Following them will make it more likely that the developers will be able to
  quickly identify the problem without having to ask you for more information.
</para>

<sect3 id="firsttime.bugs.quality">
<title>Writing High Quality Bug Reports</title>

<para>
  We encourage users to take extra time to write high-quality bug reports when
  submitting them.  This reduces wasted effort on all sides, as the reporter and
  the developer who will fix it trade emails until this information is really
  in place.
</para>

<para>
  Eli Goldberg wrote the canonical Bug-Writing Guideline, available at <ulink
  url="https://issues.apache.org/bugwritinghelp.html">https://issues.apache.org/bugwritinghelp.html</ulink>.
  Generally, you'll be well-served by following these guidelines:
</para>

<formalpara><title>Include your system information</title>
  <para>
    The <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Report
    Bug</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item will fill this in automatically,
    but if you would prefer not to use this interface, there are several items
    you need to include in the report.  We will need to know what operating
    system you are using (&Linux;, &MacOS;, or &Windows;), the version of &kde;,
    and the version of &kmymoney; you're running, and either the version of
    &MacOS; or &Windows; or the name and version of your &Linux; distribution
    and the version of your kernel.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Include a backtrace for crashes</title>
  <para>
    The backtrace is often the single most useful piece of information in
    solving crashes.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Try to reproduce it</title>
  <para>
    Let us know if you were able to do so.  It's useful to know whether the bug
    only happened once and you couldn't get it to happen again or happens every
    time or happens sometimes but not others.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Include specific steps</title>
  <para>
    This is a bad bug report: <quote>I entered a transaction, and &kmymoney;
    crashed.</quote> A much better bug report is: <quote>Using the transaction
    form, I entered a new transaction in my Credit Card account.  I selected the
    Transfer tab, entered in an amount, then changed to the Deposit tab, and
    back to the Transfer tab.  When I returned to the Transfer tab, &kmymoney;
    crashed.  This bug is fully reproducible for me.</quote>
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Tell us what you expected to happen</title>
  <para>
    In some cases, this is obvious, but in more subtle bugs, sometimes you'll
    see a bug report where it is not obvious what the reporter expected to
    happen.  Always tell us what you think should have happened.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Consider running with debugging enabled</title>
  <para>
    By compiling a version configured with --enable-debug=full you can ensure
    that the best possible backtraces are generated.  If you encounter a crash,
    run &kmymoney; again from within gdb, and reproduce the crash.  When it
    crashes, type <quote>bt</quote> to generate a backtrace.
  </para>
</formalpara>

<para>
  Running this way is a bit more difficult, so we don't expect all users to do
  this.  However, if you're interested in helping &kmymoney; become as stable as
  possible, this is the best way to do it short of finding the bug in the code
  and sending in a patch.
