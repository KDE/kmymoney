<title>Payees</title>

<para>
  The Payees View provides detailed information about all the payees and payers
  involved in transactions.  These are the entities to and from which you
  transfer money.  &kmymoney; stores information about all the payees and payers
  from all existing transactions.  This makes it possible to pick a payee from a
  list instead of having to type the full name, which also decreases the chance
  of misspelling or typing the wrong name.
</para>

<para>
  The Payees View is split into two main areas: a payees and payers list on the
  left, and a detail area on the right.  The <guilabel>Your payees</guilabel>
  section allows for adding, deleting, renaming, and merging payees.  The detail
  area has several tabs, showing the transactions, address, matching
  information, default category, and account numbers for the payee selected in
  the list.

</para>

<sect2>
<title>Adding a Payee or Payer</title>

<para>
  To add a payee or payer, choose <guibutton>+New</guibutton>.  This creates a
  new payee called <quote>New Payee</quote>.  You can also right-click on any
  existing payee and select <guimenuitem>Add payee</guimenuitem>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Renaming a Payee or Payer</title>

<para>
  To rename a payee or payer, either double-click on the name or right-click on
  the name and select <guimenuitem>Rename payee</guimenuitem>.  The name then
  becomes editable.  Changing the name will affect the name in all the
  transactions in which it appears.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Deleting a Payee or Payer</title>

<para>
  To remove a payee or payer, right-click the name and select
  <guimenuitem>Delete payee</guimenuitem>.  If the payee has any transactions,
  you will be presented with a dialog that allows you to reassign them to a
  different payee, and also a check box to enable the deleted name to be added
  to the new payee's matching list.  Another option for deleting an existing
  payee is to select the payee or payer by left clicking it and then left
  clicking <guibutton>Del</guibutton>.

<title>Overview</title>

<para>
 &kmymoney; has the ability to automatically assign the proper payee to imported
 transactions.  This can be handy when importing transactions from your bank,
 when the payee name has extra unnecessary characters, or worse, if the payee
 names change. The ability to match transactions to a particualar payee assists
 in providing a consist naming of payees within the ledger and reports.
</para>

<para>
  For example, let's say your monthly mortgage payment comes in from your bank
  like this <quote>SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY, GA 111506</quote> one month and
  then <quote>SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY, GA 121606</quote> the next month.  You
  would really like both of those transactions to be assigned to your payee
  <quote>SunTrust</quote>.  The transaction matching feature is for you!

<title>Setting up</title>

<para>
  From the Matching tab, you can set the transaction matching settings.  You can
  select one of four options with the <guilabel>Match method</guilabel>
  dropdown.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      No Matching.  This disables the feature for this payee.  This is the
      default setting for all payees.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Match Payees name (partial).  This enables the feature based on a partial
      name matching of the Payee and and uses the payee name itself as the Match
      Key.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Match Payees name (exact).  This enables the feature based on an exact
      match of the Payee.  You would use this matching ability when you want to
      keep track of different Payees that have the same business name but have
      different locations.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Match on a name listed below.  This enables matching based on multiple
      different or optional names for a Payee.  You would use this matching
      ability when you have a particular Payee that has different business
      names but you want all imported transactions identified by any of those
      names to be associated with a single Payee in &kmymoney;.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  With any of these options you can choose whether or not to ignore the case
  sensitivity of the spelling of the payee based on whether you check
  <guilabel>Ignore Case</guilabel>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Importing Transactions</title>

<para>
  The Match Keys you have set will be considered whenever you import
  transactions using the QIF import, or using a plugin such as OFX or AqBanking,
  If the Match Key for one of your payees is found anywhere in the payee of the
  imported transaction, the corresponding payee from your list will be assigned
  to that transaction.  Thus, a Match Key of <quote>SunTrust</quote> will match
  <quote>SUNTRUST BANK MAPLE VALLEY,GA</quote> or even
  <quote>MORGENSUNTRUST&amp;LOAN</quote>.  So choose your Match Keys carefully.
  <note>
    <para> If a transaction payee matches more than one Match Key, the behavior
    is undefined.  &kmymoney; will arbitrarily pick one of the matching
    payees.</para>
