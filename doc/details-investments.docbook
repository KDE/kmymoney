<title>Investments</title>

<para>
  In very general terms, an investment is any allocation of money with the
  expectation of a future benefit.  &kmymoney;'s Investment accounts are designed for
  one particular type of investment: securities.  A security investment (or just a
  security) is an instrument for investing money that is traded on a market with the
  intention of a profitable return in the form of either appreciation in value, or
  income such as interest or dividends.  Stocks and mutual funds are the most common
  securities; and they are the ones specifically supported within &kmymoney;.  Bonds
  have a different financial structure, but can usually be handled by &kmymoney;.
  Futures, commodities, options, and more complex investment instruments like
  derivatives are other types of investments, but &kmymoney; has no special
  functionality for them.  As long an investment has similar characteristics to a
  stock or mutual fund, it can be tracked.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Base Currency</title>
<para>
  Each security has a Base Currency.  This is the currency in which it is traded.
  When a price quote is entered for an investment, the currency of the value given is
  always its base currency.  A stock on the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) would be
  in US dollars (USD), and one on an Australian market would be in Australian dollars
  (AUD).  The Base currency for a security does not need to be the same as the
  default currency for the Investment account holding that security.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.investments.accounts">
<title>Investment Accounts</title>
<para>
  An Investment Account holds a collection of Securities, also referred to as
  Equities.  An Investment account contains transactions, recording activities such
  as buys, sells, dividends, reinvestments, yields, splits and income of those
  investments.  Each transaction in an Investment account must relate to a specific
  security.
</para>

<para>
  It is common for an account at a Brokerage Institution to contain both securities
  and cash.  In &kmymoney;, an Investment account holds <emphasis>only</emphasis>
  securities.  It cannot contain any cash balance.  This was a design decision made
  when Investment accounts were first included in &kmymoney;, and it might be changed
  in a future version.  For now, any cash needed to purchase a security or gained
  from a sell or dividend transaction requires the use of a Brokerage Account.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.investments.brokerage">
<title>Brokerage Accounts</title>
<para>
  When an investment transaction uses (to buy a security) or produces (from a sell or
  dividend) cash, that transaction must refer to another account which can hold the
  money, most commonly a checking account.  You can specify any suitable account for
  any investment transaction which requires one.  However, &kmymoney; has the concept
  of a <emphasis>Brokerage Account</emphasis>, also sometimes referred to as
  a <quote>Cash Account</quote>, which is the default account for such transactions.
</para>

<para>
  When you create an Investment Account, you have the option of creating an
  associated Brokerage Account with it.  The default name of the Brokerage account
  will be the name of the investment account with " (Brokerage)" appended.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.investments.investment">
<title>Creating an Investment Account</title>

<para>
  The first step on the path to working with investments is to create an account
  to hold your defined securities. Choose the <menuchoice><guimenu>Account</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>New account...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item to begin the process.
  Create an account as previously defined in the adding <guilabel>Account</guilabel>
  section, making sure to choose <quote>Investment</quote> as the type of account.
</para>

<para>
  To work with the new investment account, navigate to the
  <guibutton>Investments</guibutton> view, and choose the account you have just
  created from the <guilabel>Select Account</guilabel> dropdown box.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.investments.securities">
<title>Adding Investments to Your Account</title>

<para>
  To add individual securities to your Investment Account, navigate to the
  <guibutton>Investments</guibutton> view, select the
  <guibutton>Equities</guibutton> tab, and choose the Investment account where the
  investment is held from the <guilabel>Select Account</guilabel> drop-down box.

</para>

<para>
  Right-click the mouse in the empty space in the view.  This brings up
  the <guimenu>Investment Options</guimenu> context menu.  Choose
  <guimenuitem>New investment...</guimenuitem> from this menu.  This launches the
  <guilabel>New Investment Wizard</guilabel> which you use to create your new
  Investment.
</para>

<sect2 id="details.investments.newinvestmentwizard">
<title>New Investment Wizard</title>

<para>
  The first thing you'll be asked to enter is the type of investment, whether
  it's a stock, bond, &etc;
</para>

<para>
  Next, the investment details page is presented.  The following information is
  entered on this page:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para> Trading Symbol.  A trading or ticker symbol is an abbreviation
      used to identify a publicly traded security of a particular instrument on a
      particular stock market exchange.  &kmymoney; requires a trading symbol for all
      securities; however some investments do not have symbols.  In this case, you
      will need to make up a symbol for it.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> Full name.  The friendly, readable name of the investment you're
    creating, &eg;, <quote>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</quote> This name is also
    referred to as the security.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> Fraction.  This indicates the degree of precision to which your
    holdings are measured.  For example, in the US most mutual funds measure holdings
    to three decimal places, so you would enter 1000 in this field.  Stocks are often
    measured to only whole units, so you could enter 1 for a stock like this.  You'll
    want to mirror the same decimal places that your brokerage uses to record your
    securities so the transactions amounts match within &kmymoney;.  Using extra
    precision will not cause a problem, but using too little precision can cause
    rounding errors which can make &kmymoney; unable to exactly match the information
    shown by your brokerage institution.
  </para></listitem>
  
  <listitem><para> Trading market.  Where the stock trades.  This is an optional
    field which is provided for your convenience.  This information is not used
    anywhere else within &kmymoney;.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Identification.  An optional field to enter additional
    identification information you might like to keep track of.  Again, this
    information is not used anywhere else.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Trading currency. The market exchange currency in which this
      investment trades.  This is typically the country that the security trades
      within.  It is usually, but not necessarily, the same as the default currency
      for the Investment account holding that security.
  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para> Price entry.  Choose whether the price will be entered as the
      price per share or as the total for all shares when entering a transaction.
  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  If you are using Online Quotes, ensure that the symbol exactly matches the symbol
  used by your quote source.  Yahoo covers most of the world's markets, and requires
  a suffix on the end of symbols outside the US, to specify the country or market.
  For example, Rubicon Limited on the New Zealand market should be entered as
  <quote>RBC.NZ</quote>.
</para>

<para>
  Finally, you're presented with the Online Update screen.  This is where you
  tell &kmymoney; how you would like to update the prices of your investment.
  The following items are set here:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Use Finance::Quote.  This is an option for &gnucash; users who are used to
      this style of quotes.  Most users can leave this unchecked.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Online Source.  The online source you'd like to use for this particular
      investment.  The most common choice is <quote>Yahoo</quote>.  Try that first,
      and if the investment cannot be found using this source, then experiment with
      the others.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Factor.  A multiplier that should be applied to quotes retrieved for this
      investment.  This is most commonly needed for UK stocks where the price
      quoted is in pence (1/100), and the stock is denominated in pounds.  In
      this case, enter 0,01 for the Factor.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.investments.reuse">
  <title>Using a Security in more than one Investment Account</title>

<note>
  <para>
    This section has been added just in time for the release of Version 5.0.8.  The
    author felt it was important to include at least the basic information now, since
    this topic has been a source of difficulty for some time.  The discussion will be
    expanded and screenshots of the New Security Wizard will be added as soon as
    possible.
  </para>
</note>
      
<para>
  It is possible to own shares of the same security in different investment accounts,
  such as a regular investment account and also a retirement account.  If you follow the
  instructions above, you will have that security show up in both accounts, but
  &kmymoney; will actually treat them as if each of the securities is a different
  underlying equity.  This results in duplicate storage, such as having two copies of
  the entire price history of the equity.  Therefore, you may prefer to have both
  securities refer to the same underlying equity.
</para>

<para>
  When you add a security to an investment account, and that security already exists in
  another investment account, you need to be careful if you want to reuse it rather than
  creating a new, duplicate security.  When you see the <guilabel>New Investment
  Wizard</guilabel>, after selecting the type of investment and clicking
  <guibutton>Next</guibutton>, you need to be sure the <guilabel>Full Name</guilabel>
  field is empty before entering the <guilabel>Trading Symbol</guilabel>.  When you hit
  <keycap>Tab</keycap>, if &kmymoney; already has a security using that symbol, it will
  ask if you wish to reuse it.  If you click <guibutton>Yes</guibutton>, it will fill in
  the rest of that dialog, and you can then just click <guibutton>Next</guibutton>.
</para>

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.investments.edit">
<title>Editing an Investment</title>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Equities</guilabel> tab of the Investments view window lists your
  current holdings in this account, along with their symbol, value, quantity, and
  price.  Right-click the mouse on any of the investments to bring up the
  <guimenu>Investment Options</guimenu> context menu, where you have the option
  to add, edit, or delete individual investments from this account. Also, you
  can update the price of your investments here either manually or via their
  online source.  In addition, it is possible to close an empty account, or to
  reopen a closed account.  The order for value, quantity and price can be changed
  on the screen by selecting any of them by left clicking on the item in the top bar and
  dragging it to the left or right. 
</para>
<para>
  If you choose to Edit an Investment, you will use the <guilabel>Investment detail
  wizard</guilabel>, which looks and functions just like the <guilabel>New Investment
  Wizard</guilabel>, as described in the previous section.

<title>Activity</title>
<para>
  The Activity for an investment transaction describes what action is happening
  to the security.  The following activities are supported:
</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>Buy/Sell</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Use to record purchases or sales of individual securities.  This action
      requires an account to transfer the funds from/to, which defaults to the
      Brokerage account, if one has been created.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>Dividend/Yield</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Also known as a <quote>Cash Dividend</quote>, this action is used when you
      receive an interest or dividend disbursement from your security.  This action
      also requires an account to transfer the funds to.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>Reinvest Dividend</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Reinvest Dividend.  This is a dividend where the proceeds are used to purchase
      additional shares of the security.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>Add/Remove Shares</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      A simple increase or decrease in the number of shares you own.  This should be
      used very rarely, because it's uncommon for shares to just show up in your
      account (or disappear) unless it's a purchase or a sale.  One use of these
      activities is for some situations &kmymoney; does not natively handle, such as
      the exchange of some number of shares of a security for a different number of
      shares of a different class of the same security.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
  <term>Split Shares</term>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      This is used when the stock is split.  Enter the ratio of the split in
      the <quote>Split Ratio</quote> field.  For example, in a 3:2 split, enter 1.5.
      Reverse splits, where the ration is less than one, such as 2:3, although
      uncommon, are also allowed.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Security</title>
<para>
  Each investment transaction must be associated with an individual security.  Choose
  the security name when adding or editing a transaction.  The symbol will be
  displayed when viewing it.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Account</title>
<para>
  For any transaction which generates or requires money, you must enter the account
  where the money is transferred to/from.  If your investment account has an
  associated Brokerage account, it is usually best to transfer the funds there.  This
  applies to funds for purchase or sale of the security, as well as for fees paid or
  interest or dividends earned.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Shares, Price &amp; Total Amount</title>
<para>
  For buy, sell, and reinvestment transactions, the number of shares, the price per
  share, and the total amount of the transaction must be established.  You can enter
  any two of these, and &kmymoney; will calculate the third.  It's usually best to
  enter just the total amount and the number of shares, because these are the known
  facts of the transaction.  &kmymoney; will automatically calculate the price per
  share.  Note that there is only one entry field for the price, and it will be
  labeled
  <quote>Transaction amount</quote> or <quote>Price/share</quote> depending on the
  setting of the <guilabel>Price entry</guilabel> option when the account
  was <link linkend="details.investments.newinvestmentwizard">set up</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Fees</title>
<para>
  With many investment transactions you can include the fees (or commission) you
  paid the broker.  If you enter a category for the fee, then a field will be
  shown to the right where you can enter the amount of the fee.  If you need to
  enter more than one fee for the transaction, you can use
  the <link linkend="details.ledgers.split">Split Transactions</link> feature.
  In this case, when you complete entering all the splits, the total amount of
  the fees will be shown to the right.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Interest</title>
<para>
  This is how you enter an interest or dividend payment from a security.  As
  with fees, if you enter a category, then  a field will be shown to the right
  where you can enter the amount.  You can also use the split transaction
  feature, if required.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.investments.foreign">
<title>Working With Foreign Investments</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; supports multiple currencies and securities, and you may want to combine
  the two.  However, doing so requires extra care to assure accurate records.  As
  noted above, when you add a security, you must specify its trading currency.  This
  might not be the same as the base currency for your &kmymoney; file, and it also
  might not be the same as the default currency for the investment account in which
  you hold the stock or the account where you transfer your funds to/from for
  buys/sells.
</para>

<para>
  Consider a hypothetical case, where your base currency is USD.  You have an
  investment account in EUR, and a brokerage account also in EUR.  In that investment
  account, you hold shares of TietoEnator, which is traded in SEK.
</para>

<para>
  When you enter a buy transaction for this investment, use SEK as the currency.  So
  if you buy 100 shares at a price of SEK 248.00, for a total of SEK 24,800.00, enter
  these values in the transaction.

</para>

<sect3>
<title>How Online Quotes Work</title>
<para>
  At your request, &kmymoney; will fetch a page from the web that contains the
  latest price for each security.  By default, prices are fetched from
  <ulink url="https://finance.yahoo.com">finance.yahoo.com</ulink>, and are
  subject to the terms and conditions of that site.
</para>

<para>
  The online quote lookup uses the security's trading symbol to find the price.
  Therefore, it is important to set the symbol correctly.  Yahoo supports stocks from
  most major world markets, so it's usually just a matter of finding the correct
  symbol.  For example, TietoEnator trades on the Stockholm Stock Exchange market,
  and its Yahoo symbol is TIEN.ST.
</para>

<para>
  To find the trading symbol for a security supported by Yahoo, use the
  <quote>Symbol Lookup</quote> feature
  at <ulink url="https://finance.yahoo.com">finance.yahoo.com</ulink>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Assigning a Quote Source</title>

<para>
  In order to get online price quotes, you first have to enable it for each
  security or currency you want updated, by setting a <quote>Online Quote
  Source</quote>.  This is the name of the service from which the quote should
  be fetched.  &kmymoney; ships with several sources to choose from.  Yahoo is the
  recommended default source, and should work for most investments and all
  currencies. 
</para>

<para>
  To assign a quote source for an investment, navigate to the investment summary view
  for the account in which the security is held.  Edit the security by right-clicking
  it and selecting <guimenuitem>Edit Investment ...</guimenuitem>.  In the Investment
  Detail Wizard, click <guibutton>Next</guibutton> twice, for the Online Update
  section.  In the Online source dropdown box, select the online source for your
  needs.
</para>

<para>
  Versions of &kmymoney; starting with 0.9 contain support for the Finance::Quote
  package for obtaining online quotes.  This is intended primarily as a convenience
  for those users converting from the &gnucash; finance package, which uses it as its
  native method.  If you do select this option, you should see a different list of
  sources, those supported by Finance::Quote. If the list is empty, it suggests that
  the package is not properly installed.  See their web site at
  <ulink url="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net">

<sect3>
<title>Adjusting a quote</title>

<para>
  Some online sources do not report the price in a base quantity (&eg;, EUR) but
  in a fraction (&eg;, Cent). Using this information as price will produce wrong
  values for your investments.
</para>

<para>
  If this is the case for your online source, you can use the
  <guilabel>Factor</guilabel> field to enter an adjusting factor. For the above
  mentioned example the factor would be 0.01.

<title>Adding or Editing Quote Sources</title>

<para>
  Adding or editing quote sources is not recommended for anyone but the most
  technical user.  You should feel comfortable reading HTML and writing complex
  regular expressions.  If this doesn't sound like you, we recommend writing to the
  developer's list if none of the quote sources work for you.  Ideally, please point
  us to a web page where these quotes can be obtained.  Additionally you can consult
  with members of the KDE Community Forum for &kmymoney; as they may already have a
  solution available for your needs.
</para>

<para>
  If you do feel up to the challenge, here's how it works.  The quote sources are
  contained in the settings dialog. Choose the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
  &kmymoney;</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item. From there, choose the <guilabel>Online
  Quotes</guilabel> section.  You can choose an existing source to edit, or create a
  new one.  When you are done with your changes, be sure to press
  the <guibutton>Update</guibutton> button before exiting the dialog.  Your changes
  are not saved by default.
</para>

<para>
  The first thing to consider in an online quote source is the URL.  This is the page
  that is fetched from the web.  You will see a %1 in all sources, and a %2 in
  currency sources.  For investments, %1 is replaced by the trading symbol.  For
  currencies, %1 is replaced by the From currency, and %2 is replaced by the To
  currency.  This URL is then fetched, all HTML tags are (optionally) removed, and
  that stripped file is then sent to the page parser.
</para>

  Note that the URL can also be a file: URL, which the quote fetcher takes to be the
  path to an executable script.  It will pass any command-line arguments to it that
  you have specified, and feed the stdout to the page parser.  For example, you might
  have a script called getquote.sh that contains custom quote logic, taking the
  symbol as a single parameter.  Your URL would be
  <quote>file:/path/to/getquote.sh %1</quote>.

<para>
  The page parser looks for a symbol, a date, and a price.  Regular expressions tell
  it how to extract those items from the page.  Please review the documentation for
  the <ulink url="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qregexp.html">QRegExp
  class</ulink> for the exact syntax regular expressions used by &kmymoney;.  There
  should be exactly one capture expression, surrounded by parentheses, in each regexp
  field.  The date format further tells the date parser the order of year, month, and
  day.  This date format should always be in the form "%x %x %x". where x is y, m, or
  d.  The date parser is very smart.  <quote>%m %d %y</quote> will
  parse <quote>December 31st, 2005</quote> as easily as <quote>12/31/05</quote>.  Two
  digit years are interpreted as being in the range of 1950-2049.

<title>Unimplemented Features</title>

<para>
  There are some features that are normally associated with investments which are not
  yet implemented in &kmymoney;.  These include, but are not limited to derivatives,
  options, and futures.  In addition, when you sell a security, &kmymoney; does not
  know which specific shares you are selling, &ie;, the oldest or the most recently
  purchased, so it cannot calculate return on investment.  Finally, it has no direct
  knowledge about any country's specific tax reporting requirements, but these can
  usually be handled by marking as Tax related all the categories you use for
  transactions which might have tax consequences.
