<title>Investments in &kmymoney;</title>

<para>
  In very general terms, an investment is any allocation of money with the
  expectation of a future benefit.  &kmymoney;'s Investment accounts are designed for
  one particular type of investment: securities.  A security investment (or just a
  security) is an instrument for investing money that is traded on a market with the
  intention of a profitable return in the form of either appreciation in value,
  income such as interest or dividends, or a combination of both.  Stocks and mutual
  funds are the most common securities; and they are the ones specifically supported
  within &kmymoney;.  Bonds have a different financial structure, but can usually be
  handled by &kmymoney;.  Futures, commodities, options, and more complex investment
  instruments like derivatives are other types of investments, but &kmymoney; has no
  special functionality for them.  As long an investment has similar characteristics
  to a stock or mutual fund, it can be tracked.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Investment Accounts</title>
<para>
  A &kmymoney; Investment Account holds a collection of Securities, also referred to
  as Equities.  An Investment account contains transactions, recording activities
  such as buys, sells, dividends, reinvestments, yields, splits and income of those
  investments.  Each transaction in an Investment account must relate to a specific
  security.
</para>

<para>
  It is common for an account at a Brokerage Institution to contain both securities
  and cash.  In &kmymoney;, an Investment account holds <emphasis>only</emphasis>
  securities.  It cannot contain any cash balance.  This was a design decision made
  when Investment accounts were first included in &kmymoney;.  It might be changed in
  th future, but that is likely to be done as part of a significant revision in all
  of &kmymoney;'s handling of investments.  For now, any cash needed to purchase a
  security or gained from a sell or dividend transaction requires the use of a
  Brokerage Account.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.investments.brokerage">
<title>Brokerage Accounts</title>
<para>
  When an investment transaction uses (to buy a security) or produces case, such as
  from a sale or dividend, that transaction must refer to another account which can
  hold the money, most commonly a checking account.  You can specify any suitable
  account for any investment transaction which requires one.  However, &kmymoney; has
  the concept of a <emphasis>Brokerage Account</emphasis>, also sometimes referred to
  as a <quote>Cash Account</quote>, which is the default account for such
  transactions.
</para>

<para>
  When you create an Investment Account, you have the option of creating an
  associated Brokerage Account with it.  The default name of the Brokerage account
  will be the name of the investment account with " (Brokerage)" appended.
  &kmymoney; assumes this naming convention in several actions related to
  investments.  Following the convention is not absolutely required, but without it,
  you will often have to take extra steps to complete the entry of transactions.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Base Currency</title>
<para>
  You &kmymoney; data file has a base currency, specified when the file was created.
  In addition, an Investment account has a base currency, specified when it is
  created.  Separately, each security has its own base currency.  This is the
  currency in which it is traded.  When a price quote is entered for an investment,
  the currency of the value given is always its base currency.  A stock on the NYSE
  (New York Stock Exchange) would be in US dollars (USD), and one on an Australian
  market would be in Australian dollars (AUD).  The Base currency for a security does
  not need to be the same as the default currency for the Investment account holding
  that security.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="details.investments.view">
<title>The Investments View</title>

<para>
  The Investments View provides a summary of all your investments, similar to several
  of the other major views.  It has a single display area, with two tabs.  The first
  tab, <guilabel>Equities</guilabel>, provides a high level view of those securities
  held within a single Investment Account, as specified in the <guilabel>Select
  Account:</guilabel> dropdown.  The second tab, <guilabel>Securities</guilabel>, is
  similar, but provides slightly different information about all the stocks, mutual
  funds, bonds, &etc;, you track in &kmymoney;.
</para>

<para>
  The distinction between equities and securities on these two tabs is somewhat
  arbitrary, and is known to cause confusion.  Perhaps this may be changed in the
  future, if anyone can proposed a different set of terms that doesn't have the same
  or other problems.
</para>

<para>
  At the top of the list of equities is the <guilabel>Select Account:</guilabel> dropdown,
  where you can select the investment account for which you want to see the specific
  investments.  If you are looking at an investment account in the Legders View, and then switch
  to the Investments View, that account will already be selected. <!-- FIXME: refer to the
  setting about forcing that coordination, -->
</para>

<para>
  Simlar to the Institutions and several other views, the Equities tab displays
  several columns with descriptive and summary information about each equity.  As
  with the Institutions View, you can select which columns are shown by
  right-clicking on any column heading and selecting or unselecting the checkbox next
  to the name of the column.

<title>New Investment Wizard</title>

<para>
  The first thing you'll be asked to enter is the type of investment.  The currently
  available values are Stock, Bond, and Mutual Fund.  If your investment is not
  strictly one of these types, it is ok to mislabel here, as the type is not
  currently used to restrict or control what you can do with the investment.
</para>

<para>
  Next, the investment details page is presented.  The following information is
  entered on this page:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Trading Symbol.  A trading or ticker symbol is an abbreviation used to identify
      a publicly traded security of a particular instrument on a particular market or
      exchange.  &kmymoney; requires a trading symbol for all securities; however
      some investments do not have symbols.  In this case, you will need to make up a
      symbol for it.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you plan to use Online Quotes <!--FIXME: use real link --> to retrieve
      prices for this investment, ensure that the symbol exactly matches the symbol
      used by your quote source.  Yahoo covers most of the world's markets, and
      requires a suffix on the end of symbols outside the US, to specify the country
      or market.  For example, Rubicon Limited on the New Zealand market should be
      entered as <quote>RBC.NZ</quote>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Full name of the investment, although it can be a friendly, readable name,
      &eg;, <quote>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</quote> This name is also referred to
      as the security.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Fraction.  This indicates the degree of precision to which your holdings are
      measured.  For example, in the US most mutual funds measure holdings to three
      decimal places, so you would enter 1000 in this field.  Stocks are often
      measured to only whole units, so you could enter 1 for a stock like this, but
      you would use 10000 for a stock measured to four decimal digite.  You'll want
      to mirror the same decimal places that your brokerage uses to record your
      securities so the transactions amounts match within &kmymoney;.  Using extra
      precision will not cause a problem, but using too little precision can cause
      rounding errors which can make &kmymoney; unable to exactly match the
      information shown by your brokerage institution.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Trading market.  Where the investment is traded.  This is an optional field
      which is provided for your convenience.  This information is not used anywhere
      else within &kmymoney;.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Identification number.  An optional field to enter additional identification
      information you might like to keep track of.  Stocks often have such a number,
      which can sometimes be used as well as the symbol for retreiving information
      about it.  Again, this information is not used anywhere else.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Trading currency. The market exchange currency in which this investment is
      traded.  This is typically the currency of the country that the security trades
      within.  It is usually, but not necessarily, the same as the default currency
      for the Investment account holding that security.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Price entry.  This is a dropdown which specifies when you enter or edit a buy
      or sell transaction for this investment, whether you follow the default which
      is specied in a main configuration item <!-- FIXME: where - put linke? -->, or
      want to explicitly enter either the price per share or the total for all
      shares.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Price Precision.  This is a small integer, specifying the number of decimal
      places used to specify the price of this investment in the specified currency.
      This is used for both purchase and sale price, the current price, and also for
      the total value of the investment.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Remainder.  This is a dropdown with values Round, Ceil, Floor, and Truncate,
      which specifies what &kmymoney; should do in the last decimal place of values.
      For example, this can be relevant when you specify the total price of a
      purchase rather than an exact price per share.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  Finally, you're presented with the Online Update screen.  This is where you tell
  &kmymoney; how you would like to update the prices of your investment, if you do
  want to use an online source.  The following items are set here:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Use Finance::Quote.  This is an option for &gnucash; users who are used to this
      style of quotes.  Most users can leave this unchecked.  Finance::Quote is a
      Perl module, so to use it, you would need to have both Perl and it's
      Finance::Quote module installed.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Online Source.  The online source you'd like to use for this particular
      investment.  The most common choice is <quote>Yahoo Finance</quote>.  Try that
      first, and if the investment cannot be found using this source, then experiment
      with the others.
    </para>

    <para>
      Note that although &kmymoney; knows how to extract security prices from web
      pages retrieved from Yahoo and many other sources, those sources have been
      known to change the format of those pages, which can prevent &kmymoney; from
      succesfully extracting the desired information.  This is an unfortuantely too
      frequent topic of discussion on the various support channels.  However, if
      fetching prices works for a long time and then you start to get errors, please
      consider this possibility.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Factor.  A multiplier that should be applied to quotes retrieved for this
      investment.  This is most commonly needed for UK stocks where the price quoted
      is in pence (1/100), and the stock is denominated in pounds.  In this case,
      enter 0,01 for the Factor.
    </para>

<sect2 id="details.investments.reuse">
  <title>Using a Security in more than one Investment Account</title>

<note>
  <para>
    It is possible to own shares of the same security in differentmore than one
    investment account, such as a regular investment account and also a retirement
    account.  If you follow the instructions above, you will have that security show
    up in both accounts, but &kmymoney; will actually treat them as if each of the
    securities is a different underlying investment.  This can results in confusion,
    as well as duplicate storage, such as having two copies of the entire price
    history of the equity.  Therefore, it is preferable to have both equities refer
    to the same underlying security.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
  When you add a security to an investment account, and that investment already
  exists in another investment account, you need to be careful if you want to reuse
  it rather than creating a new, duplicate entry.  When you see the <guilabel>New

  For any transaction which generates or requires money, you must enter the account
  where the money is transferred to/from.  If your investment account has an
  associated Brokerage account, it is usually best to transfer the funds there.  This
  applies to funds for purchase or sale of the security, as well as for fees paid or
  interest or dividends earned.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Shares, Price &amp; Total Amount</title>
<para>
  For buy, sell, and reinvestment transactions, the number of shares, the price per
  share, and the total amount of the transaction must be established.  You can enter
  any two of these, and &kmymoney; will calculate the third.  It's usually best to
  enter just the total amount and the number of shares, because these are the known
  facts of the transaction.  &kmymoney; will automatically calculate the price per
  share.  Note that there is only one entry field for the price, and it will be
  labeled
  <quote>Transaction amount</quote> or <quote>Price/share</quote> depending on the
  setting of the <guilabel>Price entry</guilabel> option when the account
  was <link linkend="details.investments.newinvestmentwizard">set up</link>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Fees</title>
<para>
  With many investment transactions you can include the fees (or commission) you
  paid the broker.  If you enter a category for the fee, then a field will be
  shown to the right where you can enter the amount of the fee.  If you need to
  enter more than one fee for the transaction, you can use
  the <link linkend="details.ledgers.split">Split Transactions</link> feature.
  In this case, when you complete entering all the splits, the total amount of
  the fees will be shown to the right.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Interest</title>
<para>
  This is how you enter an interest or dividend payment from a security.  As
  with fees, if you enter a category, then  a field will be shown to the right
  where you can enter the amount.  You can also use the split transaction
  feature, if required.

<title>Working With Foreign Investments</title>

<para>
  &kmymoney; supports multiple currencies and securities, and you may want to combine
  the two.  However, doing so requires extra care to assure accurate records.  As
  noted above, when you add a security, you must specify its trading currency.  This
  might not be the same as the base currency for your &kmymoney; file, and it also
  might not be the same as the default currency for the investment account in which
  you hold the stock or the account where you transfer your funds to/from for
  buys/sells.
</para>

<para>
  Consider a hypothetical case, where your base currency is USD.  You have an
  investment account in EUR, and a brokerage account also in EUR.  In that investment
  account, you hold shares of TietoEnator, which is traded in SEK.
</para>

<para>
  When you enter a buy transaction for this investment, use SEK as the currency.  So
  if you buy 100 shares at a price of SEK 248.00, for a total of SEK 24,800.00, enter
  these values in the transaction.

<para>
  There are two ways of updating the prices for your investments.  You can
  either enter the price manually or have &kmymoney; fetch it from the web.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Manual Price Updates</title>

<title>Online Price Quotes</title>
<para>
  &kmymoney; has the ability to download the latest prices for your securities
  and currencies via the web.
</para>

<sect3>
<title>How Online Quotes Work</title>
<para>
  At your request, &kmymoney; will fetch a page from the web that contains the
  latest price for each security.  By default, prices are fetched from
  <ulink url="https://finance.yahoo.com">finance.yahoo.com</ulink>, and are
  subject to the terms and conditions of that site.
</para>

<para>
  The online quote lookup uses the security's trading symbol to find the price.
  Therefore, it is important to set the symbol correctly.  Yahoo supports stocks from
  most major world markets, so it's usually just a matter of finding the correct
  symbol.  For example, TietoEnator trades on the Stockholm Stock Exchange market,
  and its Yahoo symbol is TIEN.ST.
</para>

<para>
  To find the trading symbol for a security supported by Yahoo, use the
  <quote>Symbol Lookup</quote> feature
  at <ulink url="https://finance.yahoo.com">finance.yahoo.com</ulink>.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Assigning a Quote Source</title>

<para>
  In order to get online price quotes, you first have to enable it for each
  security or currency you want updated, by setting a <quote>Online Quote
  Source</quote>.  This is the name of the service from which the quote should
  be fetched.  &kmymoney; ships with several sources to choose from.  Yahoo is the
  recommended default source, and should work for most investments and all
  currencies.
</para>

<para>
  To assign a quote source for an investment, navigate to the investment summary view
  for the account in which the security is held.  Edit the security by right-clicking
  it and selecting <guimenuitem>Edit Investment ...</guimenuitem>.  In the Investment
  Detail Wizard, click <guibutton>Next</guibutton> twice, for the Online Update
  section.  In the Online source dropdown box, select the online source for your
  needs.
</para>

<para>
  Versions of &kmymoney; starting with 0.9 contain support for the Finance::Quote
  package for obtaining online quotes.  This is intended primarily as a convenience
  for those users converting from the &gnucash; finance package, which uses it as its
  native method.  If you do select this option, you should see a different list of
  sources, those supported by Finance::Quote. If the list is empty, it suggests that
  the package is not properly installed.  See their web site at
  <ulink url="http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net">
  http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net</ulink> for more information.

<title>Adjusting a quote</title>

<para>
  Some online sources do not report the price in a base quantity (&eg;, EUR) but
  in a fraction (&eg;, Cent). Using this information as price will produce wrong
  values for your investments.
</para>

<para>
  If this is the case for your online source, you can use the
  <guilabel>Factor</guilabel> field to enter an adjusting factor. For the above
  mentioned example the factor would be 0.01.
</para>

<para>
  The <guilabel>Factor</guilabel> field is only available if a
  <guibutton>Quote Source</guibutton> has been selected.

  single operation.  Choose the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Update Stock and Currency

  quotes dialog.  Press <guibutton>Update All</guibutton> to fetch quotes for all

<title>Adding or Editing Quote Sources</title>

<para>
  Adding or editing quote sources is not recommended for anyone but the most
  technical user.  You should feel comfortable reading HTML and writing complex
  regular expressions.  If this doesn't sound like you, we recommend writing to the
  developer's list if none of the quote sources work for you.  Ideally, please point
  us to a web page where these quotes can be obtained.  Additionally you can consult
  with members of the KDE Community Forum for &kmymoney; as they may already have a
  solution available for your needs.
</para>

<para>
  If you do feel up to the challenge, here's how it works.  The quote sources are
  contained in the settings dialog. Choose the
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
  &kmymoney;</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item. From there, choose the <guilabel>Online
  Quotes</guilabel> section.  You can choose an existing source to edit, or create a
  new one.  When you are done with your changes, be sure to press
  the <guibutton>Update</guibutton> button before exiting the dialog.  Your changes
  are not saved by default.
</para>

<para>
  The first thing to consider in an online quote source is the URL.  This is the page
  that is fetched from the web.  You will see a %1 in all sources, and a %2 in
  currency sources.  For investments, %1 is replaced by the trading symbol.  For
  currencies, %1 is replaced by the From currency, and %2 is replaced by the To
  currency.  This URL is then fetched, all HTML tags are (optionally) removed, and
  that stripped file is then sent to the page parser.
</para>

<para>
  Note that the URL can also be a file: URL, which the quote fetcher takes to be the
  path to an executable script.  It will pass any command-line arguments to it that
  you have specified, and feed the stdout to the page parser.  For example, you might
  have a script called getquote.sh that contains custom quote logic, taking the
  symbol as a single parameter.  Your URL would be
  <quote>file:/path/to/getquote.sh %1</quote>.
</para>

<para>
  The page parser looks for a symbol, a date, and a price.  Regular expressions tell
  it how to extract those items from the page.  Please review the documentation for
  the <ulink url="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qregularexpression.html">QRegularExpression
  class</ulink> for the exact syntax regular expressions used by &kmymoney;.  There
  should be exactly one capture expression, surrounded by parentheses, in each regexp
  field.  The date format further tells the date parser the order of year, month, and
  day.  This date format should always be in the form "%x %x %x". where x is y, m, or
  d.  The date parser is very smart.  <quote>%m %d %y</quote> will
  parse <quote>December 31st, 2005</quote> as easily as <quote>12/31/05</quote>.  Two
  digit years are interpreted as being in the range of 1950-2049.

<sect1 id="details.investments.unimplemented">
<title>Unimplemented Features</title>

<para>
  There are some features that are normally associated with investments which are not
  yet implemented in &kmymoney;.  These include, but are not limited to derivatives,
  options, and futures.  In addition, when you sell a security, &kmymoney; does not
  know which specific shares you are selling, &ie;, the oldest or the most recently
  purchased, so it cannot calculate return on investment.  Finally, it has no direct
  knowledge about any country's specific tax reporting requirements, but these can
  usually be handled by marking as Tax related all the categories you use for
  transactions which might have tax consequences.
