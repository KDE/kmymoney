<title>Bug fixes and enhancements to functionality</title>

<para>
  As with every release, the &kmymoney; development team continues to work hard to
  make each version better and easier to use in every way.  Many bugs have been fixed
  since the previous stable release of 5.1.4; several areas of the program have seen
  functional enhancements; but the major noticeable changes from the 5.1 series of
  releases are in the ledger - more details below.
</para>

<para>
  The conversion to using &kde-frameworks; was essentially complete in the 5.1.x
  releases, with much of that work behind the scenes and not directly visible to the
  end user.  The general look and feel should remain stable, although some minor
  changes may be noticable.  In addition, the team has begun to make changes to
  support the eventual conversion to using Qt6 and KDE6 libraries, which will
  eventually replace Qt5 and KDE5. With all these changes, the basic functionality of
  the program remains the same, aside from intentional bug fixes, improvements, and
  additions.
</para>

<para>
  In past releases, this section of the manual has included a list of many of the
  specific bug fixes and functional enhancements.  However, rather than
  duplicating that information, you can find it directly in the <ulink
  url="https://kmymoney.org/changelog.html">Changelog</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
  The 5.0.x and 5.1.x series included some changes needing adjustments on the user's
  side, if they were upgrading from 4.8.x or an older version.  However, we expect
  that most users have converted to 5.x by now.  Specifically, there should be no
  adjustments needed by users converting from 5.1.x to 5.2.  If for some reason, you
  are still using &kmymoney; version 4, you are very strongly encouraged to upgrade,
  as it is getting increasingly difficult for the team to provide any assistance for
  very old versions.

<title>Updates to this Handbook</title>
<para>
  This section used to present some details related to the lack of a complete
  handbook update from 4.x to 5.x.  The intent is that the handbook be fully updated
  for 5.2, so this section should hopefully be able to be removed before release.
