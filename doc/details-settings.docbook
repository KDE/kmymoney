<title>&kmymoney; Settings</title>

<para>
   The settings described below modify the behavior of &kmymoney;, allowing you
   to customize it to meet the needs of your unique financial affairs, and to
   modify its look and feel to match your personality.  These settings can be
   changed through <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
   &kmymoney;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item or by using the keyboard
   shortcut <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl; &Shift;<keycap>,</keycap></keycombo>.
   In order for any changes to take effect the <guibutton>Apply</guibutton>
   button must be clicked.
</para>

<para>
    On the left of the settings dialog is a list of icons and labels, each
    representing a particular area of the program.  When you click on one of
    those icons, the right part of the dialog will display controls for
    configuring that area of the program, often divided into several tabs.

      <para>Checking the <guilabel>Autosave periodically</guilabel> box instructs
      &kmymoney; to autosave your files at a defined interval.  The default value is

      entering a transaction) up to 60 minutes.</para>

      <para>Checking the <guilabel>Autosave when file is modified upon close</guilabel> box
      instructs &kmymoney; to autosave your file when the program is closed. You also have the
      option upon closing the program to backup your &kmymoney; file.  The Number of backup to
      keep can be set at 0 (Off) upto to 20 backups.  Any backup files will be stored in the same

    <listitem>
      <para>This setting does not directly affect the operation of &kmymoney;,
      but provides a convenient way to launch any external utility, such as an
      advanced calculator.  The first step is to enter the full path to your
      chosen program in the <guilabel>Calculator</guilabel> text box.  There are
      then two ways to launch the program.</para>
      <para>First, you can use
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
      Toolbars...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item to place the
      <guilabel>Calculator</guilabel> icon on the Toolbar.  Then, when you click
      that icon on the Toolbar, &kmymoney; will launch the selected
      application.</para>
      <!-- FIXME since the Settings menu is deferred to the Frameworks docs and
           not explicitly described in this manual, it would at least be nice to
           refer to the actual Calculator icon here, but I cannot find the
           source png.  It might also be nice to have a link to Settings Menu
           doc page. -->
      <para>Second, you can use
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
      Shortcuts...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item to set a custom keyboard
      shortcut. (The entry is under &kmymoney;/Calculator in that list.)  You can
      then use that shortcut to launch the application.</para>
      <!-- FIXME is not currently possible to launch the calculator from some menu
           item.  I have filed a wishlist, and when implemented, it should be
           described here, probably as the first choice. -->

      efficiency of navigating between these 2 tab views.  If it is not selected,

      <para>Setting this option to January 1, 1900 (the default value) is a good way

  This section provides information about the available plugins, and allow you

  Every plugin can be enabled or disabled, according to the state of the
  checkbox next to the name of the plugin.  In addition, at the right, there is
  also an <guibutton>information</guibutton> (&infoicon;) button for each, which
  will show the plugin version and author.  For some plugins, further
  information on configuring and using it may be found by clicking the
  configure, or tool icon just to the left of the information button.  There is
  only one plugin that requires configuration, and that is the Check printing
  plugin.
</para>

<sect2 id="details.settings.plugins.printchecks">
<title>Check printing plugin</title>

<para>
  As one example, there is a plugin for printing checks, which
  is included with the source of &kmymoney;, and should always be
  enabled.  It allows printing of a check based on the data from a selected
  transaction, with the layout controlled by an &HTML; template. You need to use a
  template which is matched to your pre-printed checks.  When you click on the
  <guibutton>configure</guibutton> (&configicon;) button, the <guilabel>Check
  printing</guilabel> configuration dialog is displayed.  At the top is a text box
  for the path to the selected template.  To the right of that is a button which
  brings up a file chooser, to select an alternate template file.
</para>

<para>
  A template file is an &HTML; file, in which specific strings are used to
  reference the fields from the transaction and from the current account and
  institution to show where they will be printed on the check.  &kmymoney; is
  shipped with some sample template files.  You should either be able to use one
  of them, or modify one to suit your needs.  When the default template is
  selected, the configuration dialog will show you the folder which contains
  the sample files.
