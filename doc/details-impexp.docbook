					<title>GnuCash Importer</title>
<sect2><title>GnuCash Files</title>

<para>
The &kappname; GnuCash importer handles direct reading of standard (XML)
files as produced by GnuCash versions 1.8 and 2.0. The following are not supported
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>import of database (Postgres) data</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>import of 'multi-book' files</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>import into an existing &kappname; file</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>import of small-business specific features (Employees, Invoices, etc.)</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>export to GnuCash files.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The import will probably only work correctly if presented with a
valid file. It is recommended that the GnuCash 'Check &amp; Repair All'
function (in the Actions menu) be run before attempting to import.
</para>

<para>
Files can be opened by specifying the file name on the command
line (<command>kmymoney &lt;filepath&gt;</command>), or by means of the &kappname; 
<menuchoice>
  <shortcut>
    <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl-O</keysym></keycombo>
  </shortcut>
  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
or
<menuchoice>
  <guimenu>File</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
menu items.
</para>

<para>
The similarity between the two products means that much day-to-day
data can be imported in a straightforward fashion. However, there are
some areas where differences arise, and various options are provided
to deal with these. The following sections will describe some of
these differences; understanding them should lead to a smoother importation.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Similarities, Differences and Terminology</title>
<sect3><title>Small Business Usage</title>
<para>
It should be noted that &kappname; is
a <emphasis>personal</emphasis> finance manager, and as such, does not directly
support any of the business features of GnuCash, such as tax tables,
payroll, and tracking of lots. Any Accounts Payable or Receivable
accounts found in a file will be imported as Liability or Asset
accounts respectively.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Accounts</title>
<sect4><title>Account types</title>
<para>
For both products, the highest level of structure in the file is
the account. &kappname; supports 5 main types of account, Asset, Liability,
Income, Expense and Equity, each of which may have various subtypes,
e.g. Checking, Credit Card, etc.
&kappname; includes a 'standard' account for each of these five types, and
all other accounts are held subordinate to one of these. &kappname; enforces
more consistency (or less flexibility, depending on your point of
view) between account types than does GnuCash, and the importer will
correct any inconsistencies it detects. This may result in a slightly
different account structure, though this can, within reason, be
amended after the import is complete. 
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Categories</title>
<para>
&kappname; uses the term Category to denote an account of an Income or
Expense type. Unlike GnuCash, these are not considered as 'ledger'
accounts and entry of transactions directly into categories is not supported; 
allocations are made during transaction entry into other account types.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Structure and Placeholders</title>
<para>
GnuCash supports the use of Placeholder accounts. In effect, these are
just read-only accounts into which no transactions can be entered,
but which function in an analogous fashion to folders in a directory
structure, as a holder for other accounts. Though &kappname; does not
support this feature as such, it does provide a parent/child account
relationship, so the importer simulates placeholders by creating
empty accounts.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3><title>Transactions and Splits</title>
<sect4><title>Balanced transactions</title>
<para>
As with GnuCash, data is entered in the form of transactions, each
generally consisting of 2 or more split entries. In fact, valid GnuCash
transactions will always contain at least 2 splits, and to conform to
GnuCash's double-entry bookkeeping standard, these must be in monetary
balance (i.e. must balance out to zero). &kappname; encourages, but does not
enforce, this standard.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Payees</title>
<para>
&kappname; prefers that all transactions have a Payee (a generic term
that encompasses both payees and payers), and unlike GnuCash,  a list of
these payees is maintained. Payee names are generated by the importer
from the GnuCash transaction's Description field.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Transfers</title>
<para>
&kappname; uses the term Transfer to describe a transaction which does
not involve a Category, but only transfers money between Asset and/or
Liability accounts.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Reconcile</title>
<para>
&kappname; provides an account reconciliation function similar to that of
GnuCash, and the corresponding transaction status will be imported.
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Commodities</title>
<para>
GnuCash uses the term Commodity to cover both currencies and
non-currency assets. These are treated separately in &kappname;.
</para>
<sect4><title>Currencies</title>
<para>
&kappname; has inbuilt support for all foreign 
<link linkend="details.currencies"> currency </link>types.
&kappname; also requires that the user specify a base
currency, this being the default currency for new accounts. The
importer will attempt to determine the most likely base currency,
though this choice may be rejected in favour of an alternative.
</para>
<para>
(NOTE: &kappname; does not currently support accounts denominated in 'defunct' currencies
(except those replaced by the Euro). At present, it will be necessary to remove
any such accounts from your GnuCash file before importing. We hope to
improve on this situation in a future release.)
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="gncsecurities"><title>Securities and Investments</title>
<para>
Non-currency assets (normally stocks and bonds) are called
Securities by &kappname;, and represent the main difference between the two
products, in that &kappname; requires any account denominated in a security
to be subordinate to an Investment Account. This is described in more
detail in the chapter on <link linkend="details.investments">Investments</link>. Though users may have
implemented such a relationship, GnuCash imposes no
defined structure on it, so the importer is unable to detect it and
perform an automatic conversion. Three options are therefore made
available:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Create a separate Investment account for each security, with
	the same name as the security</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Create a single Investment account which will act as 'parent'
	for all security accounts</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Create several Investment accounts, and assign securities to
	them as directed by the user.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
It depends entirely on user requirements which of these options is
relevant in each situation, and in some cases, manual restructuring
of accounts after importation may be necessary.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Prices and currency rates</title>
<para>
Security prices and currency exchange rates as displayed in the
GnuCash Price Editor will be imported. In addition, price and rate
entries will be generated from all transactions involving securities
and multiple currencies.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="details.impexp.gncquotes"><title>Online Quotes 
</title>
<para>
For obtaining online price and currency rate quotations, GnuCash uses
a package called Finance::Quote. Later versions of &kappname; contain support for this 
package for obtaining stock quotes, and this will be used by default when importing data.
You may however elect to convert to the native method used by &kappname;
which is covered in more detail in 
<link linkend="details.investments.onlinequotes">online quotes</link>.
</para>
<para>
If you choose to do so, the following dialog will allow selection of a 'native' &kappname;
price source, or a user-defined source, for each account for which
online quotes are required. However, the stock (ticker)
symbol will be imported unchanged. Since this symbol will almost certainly be different in the two packages, it will need to be manually edited after completion of the import process.
Future currency rate updates will not use Finance::Quote, and will always use the native retrieval method.

	</screenshot>
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="gncschedules"><title>Scheduled Transactions</title>
<para>
&kappname; does not retain the separation made in GnuCash between template
transactions and their frequency of occurrence. Transaction data will
be duplicated if the same template is used in different schedules,
but this is not likely to be of great significance. 
</para>

<sect4><title>Schedule types</title>
<para>
&kappname; classifies all schedules as one of three types, Bills,
Deposits and Transfers. Since GnuCash does not make such a distinction,
the importer attempts to determine the classification from the
accounts and direction of money movements. It may be that in some
cases incorrect assumptions are made, and these will need manual
correction.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4><title>Suspect Schedules</title>
<para>
Some features of GnuCash scheduled transactions are not available in
&kappname;, so the importer tries in each case to reach a reasonable
compromise in converting the data. These transactions will be flagged
as suspect, and the user will be given the option of editing them
directly during the import process. Examples of situations which may
cause this are:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>some frequency intervals supported in GnuCash are not currently
	available in &kappname;</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>&kappname; does not support the use of formulae and variables in
	amount fields</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>complex cases which have not yet been identified for import.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
Despite best efforts, it is possible that, due to the many options
involved, a scheduled transaction may cause a fatal error within &kappname;.
If this sort of problem seems to be occurring, the importer offers
the option to drop all suspect schedules.
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Reports</title>
<para>
&kappname; provides a comprehensive selection of configurable reports,
described in more detail in <link linkend="details.reports"> Reports. </link> 
These will not necessarily, however, match precisely those reports available in GnuCash.

<sect3><title>Decoding Options</title>
<para>
If your native language is written in letters or symbols which are different from those used in the 'Latin'
(i.e., generally Western European) languages, these will be represented in a special fashion ('encoded')
in your GnuCash file. If these letters are not displayed correctly on your screen, then they must be decoded.
Currently, it is often not possible to detect accurately which form of decoding must be used,
so you may need to set this option and select an entry from the list.
In general, the first item in the list will be that which is considered appropriate
for your locale (i.e. the country and language which was selected as native when your
operating system was installed), so this should be tried first.
Since the import process does not overwrite your GnuCash file,
you are free to experiment with any of these selections.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Transaction Notes option</title>
<para>
Under some usage conditions, non-split GnuCash transactions may contain residual, often incorrect, memo data which is not normally visible to the user. When imported into &kappname; however, due to display differences, this data can become visible. Often, these transactions will have a Notes field describing the real purpose of the transaction. If this option is selected, these notes, if present, will be used to override the extraneous memo data.
</para>
</sect3>
<sect3><title>Debug Options</title>
<para>
These need only be used in the event of import problems, which in
any case should be reported to the &kappname; developer list &devlist;.
Note that the traces produced by these options may
contain data of a confidential nature, and the Anonymize option
should be used if they are to be made publicly available.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Import Report</title>
<para>
At the end of processing, the importer produces a report showing
the number of different entities processed, and any errors or
anomalies encountered. This report will be displayed on screen, and
may be saved to a file for later review. A full report may contain
the following sections:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>Record counts</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Inconsistencies in account types and actions taken</para></listitem>

					<title>QIF Importer</title>

<sect2><title>QIF format considered harmful</title>
<para>
	Generally speaking, the QIF format should be avoided wherever possible.  
	It is a poor choice for transporting financial data.    
	Among other thing, QIF suffers from these problems:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Lack of standardized format.  Different versions of the same program will impart different meanings to the same element.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Lack of transaction identifier.  Because there is no ID number associated with each transaction, matching duplicates is haphazard at best.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Lack of expressiveness.  The grammar is really simple, and cannot portray the depth of financial information found in today's financial environment.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
	This is generally why Intuit stopped supporting QIF input at all with Quicken 2005.  
	If you have the option of getting data some other way, like OFX, always choose that option.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>How to import a QIF file</title>

<para>
	To import a QIF file, first ensure you have a valid &kappname; file open.  Then select <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>Qif</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.

</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.impexp.qifimp.profile"><title>Setting up a QIF profile</title>

<para>
	Because there is no universally standard format for the QIF file, different vendors have taken liberties with the format, and introduced their own nuances.  
	Therefore, you must create a QIF Profile before you can import a QIF file.  
	This profile tells &kappname; about the peculiarities of your file.
	To edit an existing QIF Profile, or to create a new one, press the &quot;New&quot; button on the QIF Import dialog, near the profile selector.

<para>
	The most commonly changed thing between QIF implementations is the date format.  
	So if this is the first time you're importing a QIF file, spend a few moments to figure out what format the dates are in, and set the QIF Profile accordingly.  
	See the discussion below on apostrophe format for more details.

</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Apostrophe format</title>

<para>
	Many common QIF writers use a 2-digit representation for the year. 
	This is ambiguous, because the importer cannot know which century the date belongs in.
	To make things even more complicated, QIF files will often used an apostrophe as a year separator to indicate that the date belongs in the OTHER century from the default.
</para>
<para>
	For example, if the default century is 1900-1999, the date 12/31/95 would mean 1995.  The date 12/31'05 would mean 2005.
</para>
<para>
	Because the QIF format is not standardized, it's impossible to know which century is desired.
	This is why you have to explicitly state it in the QIF profile.
	You do this by specifying which century is intended when an apostrophe is found.
	In the example above, you would set the Apostrophe Format to &quot;2000-2099&quot;, so dates with an apostrophe will be interpreted as being &gt; year 2000.
	In this case, dates without an apostrophe will be treated as being in the 1900's.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Transaction matching</title>

<para>
  As noted previously, one of the major drawbacks of the QIF format is the lack of a unique identifier for each transaction.  
  Thus, if you import a QIF file and some of the transactions are already in your ledger, you may get duplicates.  
KMM attempts to get around this by looking for transactions that look similar to those you already have.
  If it finds something that looks like the same transaction, it will discard the apparent duplicate.
</para>

<para>
  This can be a problem if you have transactions that look too similar but are actually different.
  In this case, you can try turning off the &quot;Attempt to match similar transactions&quot; option in the QIF profile.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Writing an import filter</title>

<para>
	Sometimes you may have data in a custom format, like comma-separated-values (CSV), or something else unique to your situation.  
	You can still import that file into &kappname; using a QIF Import Filter.
	A filter is a custom program you write which takes your special file as input, and produces a QIF file as output.
	This can be a shell script, a perl script, a compiled program written in C/C++, or anything else you can dream of, as long as the system can run it.
</para>
<para>
	To use it, edit your favorite QIF Profile, and select the Filter tab.  
	Enter the location of your filter program where prompted.  
	Then, whenever you do a QIF import using this profile, the file you select for importing will be run through your filter first.
</para>
<para>
	A common problem is to convert a list of comma-separated-values into a QIF file.  
	This is a textbook case for the awk tool.  
	Create a script called csv2qif.awk, with the following two lines as contents:
</para>
<programlisting>
	BEGIN { FS=&quot;,&quot;; print &quot;!Type:Bank&quot; }

	{ print &quot;D&quot;$1; print &quot;T&quot;$2; print &quot;N&quot;$3; print &quot;P&quot;$4; print &quot;M&quot;$5; print &quot;^&quot; }
</programlisting>
<para>
	Then, change the QIF keys (D,T,N,P,M) to match the order of your csv data.  
	Set the input filter to <userinput>awk -f csv2qif.awk</userinput>.
</para>

<para>
  Another problem sometimes arises in the encoding of QIF files.  
  &kappname; expects files to be UTF8 encoded.  
  If your file is encoded in something else, it can be useful to convert it to UTF8.
  For example to convert it from iso-8859-1, you would set the input filter to <userinput>recode iso-8859-1..utf-8</userinput>.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2><title>Special &kappname; QIF extensions</title>

<para>
	As noted previously, one of the major drawbacks of the QIF format is the lack of a unique identifier for each transaction.  
	If you are writing your own QIF file creator (or filter, as described above), you can overcome this problem.  
	&kappname; supports the '#' field.  
	The importer will interpret this as a unique transaction ID, and disregard it if the transaction is already in the system.
</para>

					<title>OFX Importer Plugin</title>

<sect2><title>Getting the plugin</title>

<para>
	&kappname; will import OFX files painlessly.  
	However, this functionality is not built into the core program.  
	You must obtain and install the OFX Importer Plugin.  
	Once that is installed, the command to import OFX files will automatically show up under the &quot;File | Import&quot; menu.
</para>
<para>
	If you have installed from RPM, the OFX Imported Plugin is contained within the kmymoney-ofx RPM.  
	It should be available from whatever source you got the base &kappname; RPM.  
	If you have built from sources, all you need to do is have the libOFX 0.8.1 development headers &amp; libraries installed on your system.  
	The &kappname; build process will detect these and compile the plugin.
</para>
<para>
	Should you run into trouble trying to compile &kappname;, and you are certain you have the correct version of libOFX installed, please contact the developers list &devlist; for assistance.  Include a copy of your config.log file, compressed first via gzip.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>File | Import | OFX...</title>

<para>
	The most basic way to import an OFX file is to choose the importer from the menu bar. 
	From the File menu, choose Import, and then OFX.  
	If OFX does not show up under Import, you do not have the OFX Importer Plugin installed correctly.  
	Please see the previous section.
</para>
<para>
	The first thing the importer will do is ask you which account to import the transactions into.  
	If there are transactions from multiple accounts in your file, you will be asked this question multiple times.
</para>
<para>
	After importing, some of your transactions may be flashing red in the ledger.  
	This is because they need to be assigned a category.  
	The importer was not able to automatically assign a category based on your past transaction history.
  You can edit each flashing transaction in the ledger to assign a category, and it will then stop flashing red.
</para>
<para>
	Please note that this section describes the &quot;native&quot; OFX importer.  
	OFX files may also be imported using the AqBanking Importer Plugin if you have installed that.  
	Note that the two importers do behave slightly differently, and they are written and supported by two different developers.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Importing Investments</title>

<para>
	Please note that if you are importing a file with investment transactions, those investments must first exist in your &kappname; file.
	The trading symbol is used to match, so please ensure that the symbol in &kappname; is exactly the same as the one in the file you're importing.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.impexp.webconnect"><title>Web Connect</title>

<para>
	The easiest way to import an OFX file is to set up Web Connect.  
	Visit your bank's web site, and click on a link to download an OFX file.  
	Your browser should ask you what program you would like to use to open the program.  
	Point your browser to &kappname;.  
	It will then import the downloaded OFX file into the &kappname; file you most recently had open.
</para>
<para>
	If you need to import the OFX file into some other &kappname; file, load up that file in &kappname; first, and then visit your bank.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.impexp.ofxdirectconnect"><title>Direct Connect</title>

<para>
	OFX Direct Connect is now supported in &kappname;.
	This gives you the ability to contact your bank directly to obtain statements.
	In the future, there will be more help written, and this will be moved to its own section.
</para>
<para>
	To enable this, you must compile &kappname; with the --enable-ofxbanking switch.
	This requires some additional libraries.  
	You'll need libxml++-1.0 version 1.0.1 or higher, and libcurl version 7.9.7 or higher.	
</para>
<para>
	Please be warned: Many banks require a separate signup, will give you a separate password or PIN, and may even charge you a separate fee for this service.
	No bank directly supports &kappname;.
	You'll have to tell them you want to bank directly from MS Money or Quicken.
</para>
<para>
	The first step is to configure each account you wish to download statements for.
	Go to the Accounts view, right click on the account you wish to configure, and choose &quot;Edit Account...&quot;.
	Look for the Online Banking section.
	Press the <guibutton>Setup...</guibutton> button.
	This wizard will guide you through choosing a bank, entering your username and password, and selecting an account.
</para>
<para>
	Once you have an account set up with online banking, go to the ledger for that account.
	Then from the &quot;Account/Category&quot; menu, choose &quot;Online update using OFX...&quot;.
	This will connect to you bank, and download a statement for the last 60 days.
</para>

<sect2><title>Exporting an OFX file</title>

<para>
	It is not possible to export your data as an OFX file currently.  
	If you're interested to contribute in this area, please contact the libofx development team for details.

<sect1 id="details.impexp.plugins">
					<title>Writing Importer Plugins</title>

<para>
	&kappname; contains explicit support for importer plugins.  
	If you have a custom format, and you would like to write an importer plugin, we would value your contribution.
	To do so, you'll need to compile the program from source.  
	Then use the OFX Importer Plugin as an example.
