<title>Tags</title>

<para>
  The Tags View provides information about all the tags that have been added by
  the user.  The Tags screen is split into two main areas: a list of tags and a
  detail area, which has two tabs: Transactions and Details.  The
  <guilabel>Transactions</guilabel> tab displays all the transactions associated
  with the tag.  The <guilabel>Details</guilabel> tab includes a user-defined
  color, as well as Notes, which are not used elsewhere.  Note that if you
  change the color, which is used in the symbol displayed before the tag name in
  any associated transactions, you need to click the check button at the lower
  right of the Details area for it to be saved.

<title>Adding a Tag</title>
<para>
  There are three different ways to create a new tag.  First, you can click on
  the <guiicon><inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata
  fileref="list-add.png"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject></guiicon> new tag
  icon.  Second, you can right-click on any tag and choose <guimenuitem>New
  tag</guimenuitem>. This creates a new tag called <quote>New tag.</quote>
  Right-click on this tag and select <guimenuitem>Rename tag</guimenuitem> to
  enter the name of the new tag.  Finally, you can add a new tag directly into
  the ledger page or within a split transaction by typing the name of the tag in
  the tag field.  &kmymoney; will ask if you want to add this tag and after
  selecting <quote>yes</quote> it will be added.
</para>

<title>Renaming a Tag</title>

  <guiicon>Rename tag</guiicon> (between the add and remove icons) or
  right-click on the name and then select <guimenuitem>Rename tag</guimenuitem>.
  The name then becomes editable. Changing the name will affect the name in all
  the transactions in which it appears.

<note>
<para>
  As Tags were only introduced to &kmymoney; in version 4.7, none of the methods
  for importing data are able to import tags.  It is understood that this is an
  important feature, and each import method is likely to introduce it in an
  upcoming release.
