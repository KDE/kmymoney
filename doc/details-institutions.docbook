<title>Institutions</title>

<para>
  The Institutions view provides a summary of all the accounts grouped under
  their respective institutions.  The list of accounts under any institution can be
  expanded or collapsed by clicking on the arrow to the left of the institution
  name.  The last listed institution is "Accounts with no institution assigned."
</para>

<para>
  The Institutions view displays several columns, showing information about the
  account.  It also shows the total value of all accounts in each institution.
  You can select which columns are shown by right clicking on any column heading
  and selecting or unselecting the checkbox next to the name of the column.
