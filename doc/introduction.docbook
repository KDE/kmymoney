        &kmymoney; intends to provide all important features found in the
        commercially available personal finance managers.  Although every release
        of &kmymoney; gets closer and closer to that goal, there is still work to
	be done.

<title>What &kmymoney; is not</title>

<para>
  As a personal finance manager, &kmymoney; is not intended to support the needs
  of an average business.  A small business might find sufficient functionality to
  use &kmymoney;, but features such as accounts-receivable and accounts-payable are
  not directly supported.  Most if not all the data needed for a small business, such
  as for reports for audit and taxation purposes is present, but may need to be
  extracted using various reports and then processed and assembled into the required
  formats.  In addition, it would be possible to create client, supplier, document,
  or other features through plugins.
</para>

<para>
  &kmymoney; is not simply a clone of any of the commercially available personal
  finance programs.  Although many of the features present in &kmymoney; can be found
  in other similar applications, &kmymoney; strives to present an individual and
  unique view of your finances.
