        &kmymoney; intends to provide all important features found in the
        commercially available personal finance managers.  Although every release
        of &kmymoney; gets closer and closer to that goal, there is still work to
	be done.

<title>What &kmymoney; is not</title>

<para>
  As a personal finance manager, &kmymoney; is not intended to scale to the
  needs of an average business.  A small business might find sufficient
  functionality to use &kmymoney;, but features such as accounts-receivable and
  accounts-payable are not directly supported.  However, it would be possible to
  create client, supplier, document, or other features through plugins.
</para>

<para>
  &kmymoney; is not simply a clone of the commercially available personal
  finance programs. Although many of the features present in &kmymoney; can be
  found in other similar applications, &kmymoney; strives to present an
  individual and unique view of your finances.
