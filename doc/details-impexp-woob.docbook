<sect2><title>What is Woob?</title>

<para>
  <acronym><ulink url="https://woob.tech/">Woob</ulink></acronym>, or <quote>Web
  outside of browsers</quote> is <quote>a collection of applications able to interact
  with websites, without requiring the user to open them in a browser.</quote> One of
  <ulink url="https://woob.tech/applications/">such applications</ulink> allows
  specifically to interact with <ulink
  url="https://woob.tech/applications/bank">financial
  institutions</ulink>. &kmymoney; provides a plugin that employs it directly,
  therefore allowing to import transactions from those banks and institutions which
  otherwise do not offer support for any other financial protocol that &kmymoney;
  handles.

<note>
  <para>
    &kmymoney; currently requires that you install Woob independently. Refer to the
    further sections for details.

<sect2><title>Installing Woob</title>

<para>
  You need to install Python 3 first before continuing.  All major &Linux;
  distribuitons package Python, and you should use that version, if possible.
  Otherwise, you can download a package for your system from the <ulink
  url="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official Python website</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
  With Python 3 installed, you should now be able to easily download and install
  required Woob modules.  Please refer to the instructions on the <ulink
  url="https://woob.tech/install/">Woob website</ulink>.  When it runs, &kmymoney;
  checks for the presence of Woob, and loads the plugin if it is found.  See the
  section on <link linkend="details.settings.plugins">Plugins</link> in the chapter
  on <link linkend="details.settings">Settings</link> for more information on
  confirming that the woob plugin is loaded.

<sect2><title>Using Woob</title>

<para>
  If Woob is installed, and the &kmymoney; woob plugin is loaded, you should be able
  to set it up for use with an account by invoking the <menuchoice>
  <guimenu>Account</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Map to online account...</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice> menu item.  Once that is done, the <menuchoice>
  <guimenu>Account</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Update account...</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice> menu item will download transactions for that account using Woob.
